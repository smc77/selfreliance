{"title":"Republican Liberty and Non-Domination","markdown":{"headingText":"Republican Liberty and Non-Domination","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThe revival of republican political theory in the late twentieth century represented one of the most important intellectual developments in contemporary thinking about individual freedom and political authority. Led by historians like J.G.A. Pocock and Quentin Skinner and philosophers like Philip Pettit, this republican renaissance challenged the liberal assumption that freedom consisted primarily in the absence of interference with individual choice. Instead, republicans argued that genuine freedom required the absence of domination—the condition of being subject to the arbitrary will of others—even when such domination was not actively exercised through direct interference.\n\nThis republican conception of liberty as non-domination provided a distinctive alternative to both liberal individualism and socialist collectivism that drew on insights from classical antiquity, Renaissance civic humanism, and early modern political thought. Republicans argued that their approach could address problems of social inequality, corporate power, and political manipulation that liberal theory handled inadequately, while avoiding the authoritarian implications that had plagued various forms of socialist and communist politics.\n\nYet the republican revival also faced significant challenges in adapting classical and early modern insights to the conditions of contemporary democratic societies. The republican tradition had historically been associated with small-scale political communities, active citizen participation, and shared moral and cultural commitments that seemed difficult to achieve or maintain under modern conditions. The attempt to democratize and universalize republican ideals raised questions about whether such ideals could retain their coherence and practical effectiveness when extended beyond their original historical contexts.\n\n## The Historical Recovery of Republican Themes\n\nThe scholarly recovery of republican political thought began with historians who challenged the conventional narrative that modern political ideas emerged primarily from social contract theory and natural rights philosophy. J.G.A. Pocock's *The Machiavellian Moment* traced an alternative tradition that emphasized civic virtue, political participation, and the fragility of free institutions rather than individual rights and limited government. Quentin Skinner's work on Renaissance and early modern political thought revealed how thinkers like Machiavelli, Harrington, and Sidney had developed sophisticated analyses of freedom as non-domination that differed fundamentally from liberal approaches.\n\nThis historical scholarship revealed that many of the political ideas that Americans had traditionally associated with liberalism—resistance to arbitrary power, separation of powers, mixed government, civic education—actually derived from republican rather than liberal sources. The American founders had drawn extensively on republican themes from classical antiquity and Renaissance political thought, even as they also incorporated liberal insights about individual rights and limited government. The resulting synthesis was more complex and more interesting than either purely liberal or purely republican interpretations had suggested.\n\nThe republican tradition that these historians recovered was not a single coherent doctrine but rather a family of related approaches to thinking about political freedom and civic life. What united republican thinkers across different historical periods was their shared concern with the conditions necessary for maintaining free government against the constant threats of corruption, faction, and tyranny. Republicans generally assumed that political freedom was fragile and required active maintenance through appropriate institutions and citizen virtue.\n\nThis republican understanding of political freedom differed from liberal approaches in several important ways. Where liberals typically emphasized the importance of individual rights that could be claimed against government, republicans emphasized the importance of political participation that could maintain free government. Where liberals focused on protecting private life from political interference, republicans focused on ensuring that political life remained genuinely public rather than being captured by private interests. Where liberals sought to limit government power, republicans sought to ensure that government power remained accountable to the governed.\n\nThe republican tradition also contained important insights about the relationship between economic inequality and political freedom that liberal theory often ignored or minimized. Republican thinkers from Aristotle through Harrington to Jefferson had recognized that extreme concentrations of wealth could undermine political equality and enable the rich to dominate political institutions for their own benefit. The maintenance of republican government therefore required attention to economic as well as political arrangements.\n\n## Pettit and the Theory of Non-Domination\n\nPhilip Pettit's *Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government* provided the most systematic contemporary statement of republican political theory and its implications for thinking about individual freedom and social justice. Pettit argued that the liberal understanding of freedom as non-interference was inadequate because it ignored the ways in which people could be unfree even when they were not actually being interfered with by others.\n\nPettit's central example involved the relationship between a slave and a benevolent master. Even if the master never actually interfered with the slave's choices and allowed him to live as he pleased, the slave remained unfree because he was subject to the arbitrary will of another person who could change his mind at any time. The slave's freedom depended on the goodwill of the master rather than on institutional arrangements that protected him from domination. This made his situation fundamentally different from that of a free person, even if their day-to-day experiences might be similar.\n\nThis republican understanding of freedom as non-domination had important implications for thinking about various relationships of dependence and subordination in contemporary society. Workers who depended on employers for their livelihood, women who depended on husbands for economic support, citizens who depended on bureaucratic discretion for government services—all might be subject to domination even when they were not actively being coerced or manipulated. The key question was not whether they were currently being interfered with, but whether they were vulnerable to arbitrary interference by others.\n\nPettit's theory of non-domination also provided a different approach to thinking about the proper role of government and law in protecting individual freedom. From a liberal perspective, government interference with individual choice was generally presumed to reduce freedom, even when such interference was democratically authorized and legally constrained. From a republican perspective, government action that reduced domination would generally increase freedom, even when it involved some restrictions on individual choice.\n\nThis republican approach suggested that many forms of government regulation and social provision that liberals viewed as restrictions on freedom might actually enhance freedom by reducing people's vulnerability to domination by private actors. Employment law that protected workers from arbitrary dismissal, family law that protected women from domestic violence, administrative law that constrained bureaucratic discretion—all could be understood as freedom-enhancing rather than freedom-restricting measures.\n\nBut Pettit's theory of non-domination also raised difficult questions about how to distinguish between legitimate authority and arbitrary domination. If freedom consisted in the absence of subjection to arbitrary will, then it seemed to require subjection to non-arbitrary will—but what made authority non-arbitrary rather than simply more sophisticated in its exercise of power? If democratic government was non-dominating because it was controlled by those subject to it, what about democratic minorities who were outvoted by majorities with different interests and values?\n\nPettit's responses to these questions emphasized the importance of democratic contestation and institutional design. Government authority was non-dominating when it was subject to effective challenge and revision by those affected by it. This required not merely formal democratic procedures but also substantive opportunities for citizens to influence government decisions through various forms of political participation and contestation. The goal was to create institutional arrangements that would make government power \"track\" the interests and judgments of citizens rather than the arbitrary preferences of political elites.\n\n## The Civic Republican Tradition and Democratic Participation\n\nThe republican revival also drew attention to the civic republican tradition that emphasized the importance of active citizen participation in political life. This tradition, which could be traced from Aristotle through Machiavelli to Jefferson and Tocqueville, argued that political freedom required not merely the absence of domination but also the positive capacity for self-government through democratic participation.\n\nCivic republicans argued that political participation was valuable not merely as a means of protecting individual interests but also as a form of human development that was intrinsically worthwhile. Citizens who participated actively in political deliberation and decision-making developed capacities for practical judgment, moral reasoning, and social cooperation that were unavailable to those who remained focused solely on private concerns. Political participation was thus both instrumentally valuable for protecting freedom and intrinsically valuable for human flourishing.\n\nThis civic republican emphasis on the developmental value of political participation provided resources for criticizing both liberal and socialist approaches that treated politics primarily as a means of achieving other goods rather than as a good in itself. Liberal theory's focus on protecting private life from political interference ignored the ways in which political engagement could enhance rather than threaten individual development. Socialist theory's focus on economic transformation often treated political participation as secondary to more fundamental changes in material conditions.\n\nBut the civic republican tradition also faced obvious challenges in applying its ideals to the conditions of modern democratic societies. The classical republican emphasis on small-scale political communities where all citizens could know each other personally and participate directly in political deliberation seemed unrealistic for large, diverse, and complex modern societies. The republican assumption of shared moral and cultural commitments seemed incompatible with the pluralism that characterized contemporary democracies.\n\nContemporary civic republicans attempted to address these challenges by developing new forms of democratic participation that could work within the constraints of modern conditions. Deliberative democracy, participatory budgeting, citizen assemblies, and various forms of community organizing all represented attempts to create opportunities for meaningful citizen engagement that did not require the small-scale homogeneity of classical republics.\n\nThese contemporary adaptations of civic republican ideals achieved some notable successes in increasing citizen engagement and improving the quality of democratic deliberation. But they also revealed the difficulty of sustaining high levels of political participation among citizens who had many competing demands on their time and attention. The republican ideal of active citizenship often seemed to require levels of civic commitment that were unrealistic for most people under modern conditions.\n\n## Economic Democracy and Workplace Republicanism\n\nOne of the most important contemporary developments in republican theory involved the extension of republican principles to economic relationships and workplace organization. If domination in political relationships was incompatible with freedom, then domination in economic relationships should be equally problematic. This suggested that republican ideals required not merely political democracy but also economic democracy that would eliminate arbitrary power in workplaces and markets.\n\nThis republican approach to economic questions provided a distinctive alternative to both laissez-faire capitalism and state socialism. Unlike defenders of free markets who argued that voluntary exchanges were inherently non-coercive, republicans recognized that market relationships often involved significant asymmetries of power that could enable domination even when formal coercion was absent. Unlike socialists who focused primarily on class conflict and economic exploitation, republicans focused on the ways in which economic arrangements could either support or undermine the independence and dignity necessary for democratic citizenship.\n\nContemporary republicans like Pettit and Elizabeth Anderson developed sophisticated analyses of how workplace relationships could be organized to minimize domination and enhance worker freedom. Worker cooperatives, employee stock ownership, co-determination schemes, and various forms of industrial democracy all represented attempts to give workers greater control over their working conditions and protection from arbitrary treatment by employers.\n\nThese republican approaches to economic democracy differed from traditional socialist approaches in several important ways. Republicans were generally more concerned with preventing domination than with achieving equality of outcomes. They were more willing to accept market mechanisms that operated within appropriate institutional constraints than to replace markets with comprehensive planning. They were more focused on empowering workers as individuals and citizens than on mobilizing them as members of a revolutionary class.\n\nBut republican approaches to economic democracy also faced significant practical challenges. The competitive pressures of global markets seemed to require forms of efficiency and flexibility that were difficult to achieve through democratic workplace organization. The complexity of modern production processes seemed to require specialized knowledge and centralized coordination that were incompatible with widespread democratic participation. The mobility of capital and the internationalization of economic relationships seemed to limit the capacity of particular political communities to implement republican economic reforms.\n\nContemporary republicans responded to these challenges by developing more modest and flexible approaches to economic democracy that could work within existing market systems while gradually expanding opportunities for worker participation and control. But the tension between republican ideals and market constraints remained a persistent source of difficulty for those seeking to apply republican principles to contemporary economic problems.\n\n## The Problem of Scale and Complexity\n\nThe republican revival faced fundamental challenges in adapting classical and early modern political ideas to the scale and complexity of contemporary democratic societies. The republican tradition had historically assumed that free government required relatively small political communities where citizens could know each other personally and participate directly in political deliberation. These assumptions seemed incompatible with the large, diverse, and interconnected societies that characterized the modern world.\n\nContemporary republicans attempted to address this problem of scale through various forms of federalism, subsidiarity, and institutional design that could preserve opportunities for meaningful citizen participation while enabling effective governance of large and complex societies. The goal was to create multiple levels of democratic participation that could connect local communities to regional and national political institutions without sacrificing either democratic accountability or governing capacity.\n\nThese efforts achieved some success in developing new forms of multilevel governance that could balance local autonomy with broader coordination. The European Union, various forms of federal and confederal arrangements, and experiments in regional governance all represented attempts to apply republican principles to political communities that transcended traditional national boundaries.\n\nBut the problem of scale also raised deeper questions about whether republican ideals could retain their meaning and effectiveness when extended beyond their original contexts. The republican emphasis on citizen virtue, political participation, and shared commitment to the common good seemed to require levels of social cohesion and cultural consensus that were difficult to achieve in large and diverse societies. The republican concern with preventing domination and maintaining independence seemed to require forms of economic and social equality that were difficult to sustain under conditions of global competition and technological change.\n\n## The Contemporary Relevance of Republican Insights\n\nDespite these challenges, the republican revival provided important insights about individual freedom and political authority that remained relevant for contemporary democratic societies. The republican understanding of freedom as non-domination offered resources for addressing problems of inequality, corporate power, and political manipulation that liberal theory handled inadequately. The republican emphasis on civic participation provided alternatives to both individualistic and technocratic approaches to democratic governance.\n\nThe republican tradition also offered valuable perspectives on the relationship between individual freedom and social solidarity that differed from both liberal and communitarian alternatives. Republicans recognized that individual freedom required social support and institutional protection, but they also insisted that such support should enhance rather than replace individual agency and responsibility. The goal was to create social conditions that would enable all citizens to achieve the independence and dignity necessary for democratic participation.\n\nContemporary discussions of economic inequality, corporate power, and democratic decline often drew on republican themes even when they did not explicitly acknowledge their republican origins. The concern with \"crony capitalism,\" the emphasis on transparency and accountability in government, the call for greater citizen engagement in political life—all reflected republican insights about the conditions necessary for maintaining free government.\n\nBut the contemporary appropriation of republican themes also revealed the difficulty of applying classical political insights to modern conditions without significant modification and adaptation. The republican emphasis on civic virtue and political participation required new forms of institutional support and cultural encouragement that were not automatically generated by democratic procedures alone. The republican concern with preventing domination required new approaches to regulating economic and social relationships that went beyond traditional liberal protections of individual rights.\n\nUnderstanding both the insights and the limitations of the republican tradition is important for contemporary efforts to address the challenges facing democratic societies. The republican recognition that freedom requires more than the absence of interference provides valuable resources for social criticism and institutional reform. But the republican emphasis on civic participation and shared commitment to the common good requires careful adaptation to the realities of modern pluralistic societies.\n\nThe republican revival thus represents both an important recovery of neglected insights about freedom and democracy and a challenging reminder of the difficulties involved in maintaining free government under modern conditions. Its continuing influence reflects both the persistent appeal of republican ideals and the ongoing struggle to find adequate institutional expressions for such ideals in contemporary democratic societies.\n\nThe republican contribution to thinking about self-reliance and individual responsibility is both more modest and more demanding than either liberal or existentialist alternatives. More modest because it recognizes that individual freedom depends on social and institutional support that cannot be taken for granted. More demanding because it insists that such freedom requires active citizen engagement and ongoing commitment to the common good that go beyond the protection of individual rights or the pursuit of personal authenticity.\n\nThis republican understanding of the relationship between individual freedom and civic responsibility provides important resources for contemporary efforts to preserve democratic institutions and values while addressing the social and economic challenges that threaten their sustainability. But it also requires new forms of political imagination and institutional innovation that can adapt classical insights to modern conditions without losing their essential meaning and purpose.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","reference-location":"block","output-file":"17_republican.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

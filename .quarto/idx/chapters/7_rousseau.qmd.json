{"title":"Chapter 7: Social Contract Theory and Political Self-Creation","markdown":{"headingText":"Chapter 7: Social Contract Theory and Political Self-Creation","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThe emergence of social contract theory in the seventeenth century represents one of the most audacious intellectual projects in the history of political thought: the attempt to ground legitimate government in human choice rather than divine appointment, natural hierarchy, or historical tradition. Yet this apparently secular revolution in political thinking was made possible by, and remained deeply dependent upon, the theological developments we have been tracing. The contractarian thinkers did not simply reject the Christian understanding of human nature and political authority; they translated it into new vocabularies and applied it to new problems, creating hybrid doctrines that were simultaneously more democratic and more individualistic than their medieval predecessors, but also more unstable and more vulnerable to fundamental criticism.\n\nThe contractarian revolution was both cause and consequence of a broader crisis in traditional sources of political authority. The religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had discredited appeals to divine revelation as foundations for political order. The decline of feudalism had undermined traditional justifications based on inherited status and personal loyalty. The emergence of centralized monarchies had challenged the corporate privileges and local autonomies that had structured medieval political life. In this context, the idea that legitimate government must be based on the consent of the governed offered an apparently rational and peaceful alternative to the chaos of competing authorities and conflicting claims.\n\nBut social contract theory also reflected deeper transformations in thinking about human nature, individual rights, and the proper purposes of political community. The contractarian thinkers inherited from their Christian predecessors a conviction that every individual possessed inherent dignity and moral worth that no earthly authority could legitimately violate. They also inherited assumptions about human moral capacity and rational agency that had been developed through centuries of theological reflection. What they attempted to do was to preserve these insights while dispensing with their theological foundations, creating secular arguments for conclusions that had originally depended on religious premises.\n\n## Hobbes and the Artificial Creation of Political Order\n\nThomas Hobbes occupies a unique position in the development of contractarian thought—he accepted the logic of individualism and consent more consistently than any of his successors, but drew conclusions from these premises that most liberals have found unacceptable. Hobbes's achievement was to show what political life would look like if it were genuinely based on nothing more than individual self-interest and voluntary agreement, without the moderating influence of natural law, divine command, or inherited moral tradition.\n\nHobbes's account of the state of nature in *Leviathan* represents one of the most influential thought experiments in the history of political philosophy. By imagining human beings stripped of all social relationships and institutional constraints, Hobbes sought to identify what was truly natural and universal about human motivation and behavior. His famous conclusion—that such a condition would be \"a war of every man against every man\" in which life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\"—was designed to demonstrate the absolute necessity of artificial political authority for human survival and flourishing.\n\nBut Hobbes's state of nature was not simply a historical hypothesis or anthropological observation. It was a philosophical construction designed to illuminate the logical foundations of political obligation. By showing that rational self-interested individuals would voluntarily agree to submit to absolute sovereign authority in order to escape the terrors of anarchy, Hobbes argued that legitimate government required no justification beyond its effectiveness in providing security and enabling cooperation. Political authority was artificial rather than natural, but it was no less necessary or binding for being artificial.\n\nThe implications of this Hobbesian analysis were revolutionary. If political authority was based on human agreement rather than divine appointment, then it could in principle be altered or abolished when it failed to serve the purposes for which it was established. If sovereignty was artificial rather than natural, then there was no inherent reason why it should be exercised by kings rather than parliaments, aristocrats rather than commoners, or any other particular group or institution.\n\nAt the same time, Hobbes's absolutist conclusions revealed the difficulty of maintaining stable political order on purely contractarian foundations. If individuals possessed the natural right to judge for themselves whether the sovereign was fulfilling the terms of the social contract, then the unity and effectiveness of political authority would be constantly threatened by disagreement and resistance. Hobbes's solution—to argue that subjects surrendered their right of private judgment when they consented to political authority—preserved the logic of consent while eliminating its potentially anarchic implications.\n\nThis Hobbesian paradox—that the social contract simultaneously required and eliminated individual autonomy—would prove to be one of the central problems of liberal political theory. How could government be based on consent without being vulnerable to constant dissolution by dissent? How could individual rights be protected without undermining the authority necessary to protect them? How could rational self-interest generate obligations that transcended immediate self-interest?\n\n## Locke and the Preservation of Natural Rights\n\nJohn Locke's *Two Treatises of Government* represented a systematic attempt to preserve the benefits of contractarian thinking while avoiding the absolutist implications that Hobbes had drawn from similar premises. Locke's strategy was to argue that individuals possessed natural rights that existed prior to political society and that could not be legitimately violated even by governments based on popular consent. This move allowed him to maintain both the voluntary foundation of political authority and meaningful limits on the exercise of such authority.\n\nLocke's account of natural rights was deeply influenced by his theological commitments, though he presented it in largely secular terms. The rights to life, liberty, and property were grounded in the fact that individuals were \"the workmanship of one omnipotent and infinitely wise maker\" who had created them for his own purposes rather than for the use of one another. This theological foundation provided objective moral constraints on human action that mere human agreement could not legitimately override.\n\nThe Lockean understanding of property was particularly important for later liberal thought. By arguing that individuals acquired property rights through mixing their labor with natural resources, Locke provided a secular justification for private ownership that did not depend on the grant of political authority. This meant that economic freedom was a natural right that existed prior to government and that legitimate government was obligated to protect rather than regulate according to its own purposes.\n\nLocke's theory of political resistance followed logically from his understanding of natural rights and limited government. If the primary purpose of political authority was to protect natural rights, then government that systematically violated such rights forfeited its claim to legitimacy. If political power was held in trust for the benefit of the governed, then trustees who betrayed their trust could be legitimately replaced. The right of revolution was not merely a practical necessity but a moral obligation when government became destructive of the ends for which it was established.\n\nBut Locke's synthesis of natural rights and popular government also contained tensions that would prove difficult to resolve. If individuals possessed natural rights that could not be violated even by democratic majorities, then popular sovereignty was limited in ways that seemed to contradict the logic of consent. If property rights were natural and inviolable, then economic inequality might undermine the political equality that democratic government required. If the right of revolution belonged to individuals rather than communities, then political stability would be constantly threatened by private judgment about governmental legitimacy.\n\nThese Lockean tensions became particularly acute in the American constitutional context, where the founders attempted to create a government that was simultaneously based on popular consent and limited by individual rights. The complex system of checks and balances, federalism, and judicial review that emerged from their deliberations represented an ingenious but unstable attempt to reconcile democratic and liberal principles that were not easily harmonized.\n\n## Rousseau's Democratic Transformation\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau's *Social Contract* represented the most radical attempt to work out the democratic implications of contractarian thinking. Where Hobbes had used consent to justify absolute government and Locke had used it to justify limited government, Rousseau used it to justify what he called \"popular sovereignty\"—the idea that legitimate political authority could belong only to the people themselves acting as a collective body.\n\nRousseau's famous opening declaration—\"Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains\"—expressed his conviction that the existing political arrangements of eighteenth-century Europe were fundamentally illegitimate because they were based on force and fraud rather than genuine consent. His proposed solution was the creation of political communities in which each individual would \"put his person and all his power in common under the supreme direction of the general will\" while remaining \"as free as before\" because he would be obeying only laws that he had participated in making.\n\nThis Rousseauian vision of democratic self-government was both more egalitarian and more demanding than earlier contractarian theories. It was more egalitarian because it insisted that political authority could legitimately belong only to the entire community rather than to particular individuals or groups within it. It was more demanding because it required a degree of civic virtue and public-spiritedness that most contractarian thinkers had considered unrealistic or unnecessary.\n\nRousseau's concept of the \"general will\"—the collective judgment of the political community about what served the common good—was designed to reconcile individual freedom with political authority. When citizens obeyed laws that expressed the general will, they were not submitting to external constraint but rather acting on their own deepest and most rational desires. True freedom consisted not in doing whatever one wanted but in willing what was genuinely good for oneself as a member of a political community.\n\nBut this Rousseauian solution to the problem of political obligation created new difficulties about the relationship between individual conscience and collective judgment. If the general will was always right, what happened when individual citizens believed that particular laws or policies violated their moral convictions? If democratic participation was supposed to transform private interest into public spirit, what guaranteed that such transformation would actually occur? If political communities were supposed to be small and homogeneous enough to generate genuine common purposes, how could modern commercial societies achieve the scale necessary for defense and prosperity?\n\nRousseau's own answers to these questions were often ambiguous or unsatisfying, and his influence on subsequent political thought has been correspondingly controversial. Critics have argued that his emphasis on collective unity and moral transformation contained totalitarian potentials that became evident during the French Revolution and its aftermath. Defenders have countered that his insights about democratic participation and civic education remain essential for any adequate theory of political legitimacy.\n\n## The American Experiment: Federalism and Representative Government\n\nThe American founding represents the most ambitious practical attempt to implement contractarian principles in the creation of actual political institutions. The Declaration of Independence articulated Lockean principles about natural rights and governmental legitimacy with unprecedented clarity and conviction. The Articles of Confederation attempted to preserve maximum state autonomy while creating minimal national authority. The Constitution represented a more complex effort to balance popular government with individual rights, democratic participation with effective governance, local autonomy with national unity.\n\nThe theoretical innovations of the American founders—particularly James Madison's analysis of faction and the extended republic—represented significant contributions to contractarian political theory. Madison's insight that large, diverse republics might be more conducive to liberty and stability than small, homogeneous democracies challenged conventional wisdom that dated back to classical antiquity. His argument that representative government could improve upon direct democracy by filtering popular will through elected officials provided a practical solution to problems that had plagued democratic theory for centuries.\n\nThe American system of federalism represented another important innovation in contractarian thinking. By dividing sovereignty between state and national governments, the founders attempted to preserve the benefits of both local self-government and large-scale political organization. Citizens would be members of multiple political communities with different purposes and powers, allowing them to participate in governance while avoiding the concentration of authority that threatened individual liberty.\n\nBut the American experiment also revealed the practical difficulties of implementing contractarian principles in complex modern societies. The exclusion of women, slaves, and Native Americans from full political participation contradicted the universalistic implications of natural rights theory. The emergence of political parties created forms of organized faction that the founders had hoped to avoid. The development of industrial capitalism generated economic inequalities that challenged assumptions about the compatibility of private property and political equality.\n\nThe American Civil War represented a crisis in contractarian thinking that illuminated fundamental tensions within liberal political theory. If political communities were based on voluntary agreement, did they have the right to dissolve such agreements when circumstances changed? If individual rights were natural and universal, how could some human beings be legitimately excluded from their protection? If democratic government required shared moral commitments, how could political unity be maintained in the face of fundamental disagreement about justice?\n\n## The Limits of Contractarian Logic\n\nSocial contract theory succeeded in providing secular foundations for many political principles that had previously depended on religious authority—individual rights, limited government, popular sovereignty, political equality. But it also revealed the difficulty of maintaining these principles without the theological assumptions that had originally supported them. The contractarian attempt to ground political obligation in rational self-interest and voluntary agreement created new forms of instability and moral uncertainty that continue to challenge liberal democratic societies.\n\nThe problem of political obligation proved particularly intractable for contractarian thinkers. If political authority was based on consent, why were individuals obligated to obey laws that they had not personally agreed to? If social contracts were voluntary agreements, why could they not be dissolved when circumstances changed or when parties no longer found them beneficial? If legitimate government required ongoing consent, how could political stability be maintained in the face of constant disagreement about governmental policies?\n\nVarious contractarian responses to these questions—hypothetical consent, tacit consent, implicit consent—all seemed to abandon the voluntaristic premises that had motivated the contractarian project in the first place. The attempt to ground political obligation in actual historical agreement led to implausible claims about the origins of existing governments. The attempt to ground it in rational agreement about hypothetical arrangements led to controversial claims about what rational individuals would or should choose.\n\nThe contractarian understanding of individual rights also proved more problematic than its advocates had anticipated. If rights were natural and pre-political, how could they be enforced without political authority? If they were absolute and inviolable, how could conflicts between different rights be resolved? If they belonged to individuals as such, how could the social cooperation necessary for their protection be maintained? The attempt to combine individual rights with political authority required compromises and balances that seemed to contradict the logic of both.\n\n## The Theological Substructure of Liberal Politics\n\nDespite their secular vocabulary and rational methodology, the contractarian thinkers remained deeply dependent on theological assumptions about human nature and moral obligation that they rarely acknowledged or defended. The idea that all individuals possessed equal dignity and rights required some account of what made human beings different from other animals and deserving of special respect. The idea that political authority must be justified to those subject to it presupposed that human beings were rational agents capable of moral judgment. The idea that legitimate government must serve the common good rather than the private interest of rulers assumed objective moral standards that transcended particular preferences and agreements.\n\nThese assumptions about human dignity, rational agency, and moral objectivity had been developed through centuries of Christian theological reflection and were not obviously sustainable without their theological foundations. The attempt to preserve Christian insights about human worth and political responsibility while dispensing with Christian doctrines about divine creation and moral law created an unstable hybrid that would prove vulnerable to more consistent materialistic and relativistic challenges.\n\nThe contractarian tradition thus represents both the high point of early modern political thought and the beginning of its internal decomposition. By successfully translating theological insights about human dignity into secular political principles, contractarian thinkers created intellectual resources that would prove enormously influential for later democratic and liberal movements. By severing these principles from their theological foundations, they also created philosophical problems that would challenge the coherence and stability of liberal democratic societies.\n\nUnderstanding this contractarian achievement and its limitations is crucial for comprehending both the possibilities and the vulnerabilities of modern political life. The notion that legitimate government must be based on consent and directed toward the protection of individual rights remains one of the defining characteristics of Western political culture. But the difficulty of providing adequate philosophical foundations for these principles without appealing to transcendent sources of moral authority continues to generate intellectual and practical problems that purely secular approaches seem unable to resolve.\n\nThe contractarian legacy thus illustrates the broader theme of our intellectual history: the secularization of Christian insights about human dignity and individual responsibility created new possibilities for political freedom and social progress, but it also created new forms of moral uncertainty and institutional instability that continue to shape contemporary political life. The creative tension between individual freedom and social authority that contractarian thinkers attempted to resolve through rational agreement and institutional design remains one of the central challenges of modern political thought.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","reference-location":"block","output-file":"7_rousseau.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

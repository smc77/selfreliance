{"title":"Later Socialist Critiques of Autonomy","markdown":{"headingText":"Later Socialist Critiques of Autonomy","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThe collapse of Marx's revolutionary predictions by the early twentieth century—the failure of the proletariat to develop revolutionary consciousness, the integration of working-class movements into capitalist democracies, the outbreak of nationalist wars that divided rather than united the international working class—forced socialist thinkers to develop more sophisticated analyses of why individual autonomy and self-reliance remained so powerful despite their apparent irrationality under capitalist conditions. The result was a series of theoretical innovations that deepened and extended the Marxist critique of liberal individualism while acknowledging complexities that Marx himself had not fully anticipated.\n\nThese later socialist thinkers—Antonio Gramsci, the Frankfurt School, Louis Althusser—shared Marx's conviction that genuine individual freedom was impossible under capitalist conditions, but they developed more nuanced accounts of how capitalist society maintained itself through cultural and psychological as well as economic means. Their analyses of hegemony, false consciousness, and ideological state apparatuses provided more sophisticated explanations of why people continued to believe in individual autonomy even when material conditions seemed to make such beliefs objectively false.\n\nYet these theoretical sophistications also created new problems for socialist politics and Marxist theory. The more complex and pervasive the mechanisms of capitalist domination appeared to be, the more difficult it became to explain how revolutionary consciousness could emerge or how socialist transformation could be achieved. The deeper the critique of autonomous agency went, the more questionable became the assumption that individuals could choose to engage in revolutionary politics based on rational understanding of their objective interests. The result was a series of intellectual and political crises that would eventually contribute to the decline of Marxist influence in Western intellectual life.\n\n## Gramsci and the Concept of Hegemony\n\nAntonio Gramsci's analysis of hegemony represented perhaps the most important theoretical development in Marxist thought after Marx himself. Writing in fascist prisons during the 1920s and 1930s, Gramsci sought to understand why socialist revolution had failed in Western Europe despite the economic crises and social conflicts that Marx had predicted would lead to the collapse of capitalism. His answer focused on the cultural and ideological dimensions of capitalist rule that Marx had not adequately analyzed.\n\nGramsci distinguished between \"domination\" (*dominio*) and \"hegemony\" (*egemonia*) as two different modes of class rule. Domination involved the direct use of coercive force through state institutions—police, military, courts, prisons—to suppress opposition and maintain order. Hegemony involved the more subtle process of intellectual and moral leadership through which the dominant class convinced subordinate classes that the existing social order was natural, inevitable, and beneficial to all.\n\nThis Gramscian understanding of hegemony provided a more complex account of how individual consciousness was shaped by class relations than Marx's relatively crude analysis of ideology. Hegemony was not simply a matter of the ruling class imposing false ideas on passive masses, but rather an active process of negotiation and compromise through which dominant groups maintained their leadership by incorporating some of the demands and aspirations of subordinate groups while preserving the essential features of the capitalist system.\n\nThe concept of hegemony also helped explain why liberal ideas about individual freedom and democratic participation remained so compelling despite their apparent contradiction with capitalist reality. These ideas were not simply lies or illusions, but rather partial truths that reflected real if limited possibilities for individual and collective agency within capitalist democracy. The problem was that they were presented as complete truths that obscured the structural limitations on genuine freedom and democracy under capitalist conditions.\n\nGramsci's analysis suggested that capitalist societies maintained themselves not merely through economic coercion or political force, but through the creation of what he called \"common sense\"—widely shared assumptions about human nature, social organization, and moral value that made capitalist relations seem natural and inevitable rather than historically contingent and changeable. This common sense was produced and reproduced through a wide range of cultural institutions—schools, churches, newspapers, popular entertainment—that shaped individual consciousness in ways that supported rather than challenged the existing social order.\n\nThe implications of this analysis for thinking about individual autonomy were profound and disturbing. If hegemonic control operated through the very categories of thought and feeling that individuals used to understand themselves and their world, then the liberal celebration of autonomous choice might be not merely limited but actively counterproductive. People might experience themselves as free and self-determining while actually reproducing forms of consciousness and behavior that served the interests of their oppressors rather than their own authentic needs and aspirations.\n\nGramsci's concept of the \"organic intellectual\" represented his attempt to resolve the political problems created by this analysis. Unlike traditional intellectuals who claimed to be independent of class interests, organic intellectuals understood themselves as representatives of particular social groups and sought to develop forms of consciousness that could challenge hegemonic control. The revolutionary party could serve as a \"collective intellectual\" that helped subordinate groups develop alternative forms of common sense based on their own experience and interests rather than on the categories imposed by dominant culture.\n\nBut Gramsci's analysis also raised fundamental questions about the possibility of authentic individual agency that he did not fully resolve. If hegemonic control was as pervasive as his analysis suggested, how could organic intellectuals themselves escape from the dominant common sense sufficiently to develop genuine alternatives? If individual consciousness was shaped by structural conditions and cultural institutions, what guaranteed that revolutionary consciousness would be more authentic than bourgeois consciousness? If the very concepts of freedom and autonomy were products of hegemonic control, what would genuine liberation look like?\n\n## The Frankfurt School and the Critique of Instrumental Reason\n\nThe Frankfurt School—including theorists like Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, and Herbert Marcuse—developed the most systematic and influential critique of Enlightenment rationality and liberal individualism in twentieth-century Marxist thought. Their analysis of the \"dialectic of enlightenment\" argued that the same rational principles that had originally promised human liberation from traditional authority had become instruments of new and more complete forms of domination under advanced capitalist conditions.\n\nThe Frankfurt School's critique focused particularly on what they called \"instrumental reason\"—the reduction of rationality to the efficient calculation of means to achieve given ends without critical reflection on the ends themselves. This instrumental approach to reason had proven enormously effective for developing scientific knowledge and technological power, but it had also created forms of social organization that treated human beings as objects to be manipulated rather than subjects capable of self-determination.\n\nHorkheimer and Adorno's *Dialectic of Enlightenment* traced this development from the ancient Greek origins of Western rationality through its culmination in fascist and capitalist forms of \"totally administered society.\" The same logical principles that enabled human beings to understand and control natural forces also enabled social elites to understand and control human behavior through techniques of mass persuasion, bureaucratic organization, and technological manipulation. The Enlightenment promise of rational autonomy had been transformed into new forms of irrationality and heteronomy.\n\nThis Frankfurt School analysis provided a more fundamental critique of liberal individualism than previous Marxist approaches. Where earlier Marxists had generally assumed that rational analysis would lead to revolutionary consciousness once material conditions were properly understood, the Frankfurt School argued that rationality itself had been corrupted by capitalist social relations. The very forms of thinking that liberal theory celebrated as sources of individual freedom—scientific method, logical analysis, cost-benefit calculation—had become instruments of social control that prevented genuine critical reflection.\n\nHerbert Marcuse's concept of \"one-dimensional thought\" expressed this insight in its most influential form. Advanced capitalist society had created forms of cultural integration that eliminated the critical distance necessary for genuine opposition or authentic individual development. The apparent diversity of choices available to consumers in market society concealed a deeper uniformity of consciousness that prevented people from imagining genuine alternatives to existing arrangements. The very satisfaction of material needs through capitalist production created new forms of false consciousness that were more difficult to challenge than the obvious deprivation that Marx had expected to generate revolutionary consciousness.\n\nMarcuse's analysis of \"repressive tolerance\" extended this critique to liberal democratic institutions that appeared to protect individual freedom and political dissent. The formal tolerance of diverse viewpoints in liberal society actually served to neutralize genuine opposition by channeling it into harmless forms of cultural expression or political ritual. The apparent freedom to criticize existing institutions concealed the absence of real power to change them. Democratic participation became a form of symbolic activity that provided the illusion of collective self-determination while preserving the reality of elite control.\n\nThe Frankfurt School's critique of instrumental reason also provided a more sophisticated account of how individual personality was shaped by capitalist social relations. Drawing on Freudian psychoanalysis as well as Marxist social theory, they argued that modern forms of socialization created \"authoritarian personalities\" that were predisposed to accept rather than challenge hierarchical authority. The nuclear family, mass education, and bureaucratic organization all contributed to the formation of individuals who craved security and order more than freedom and creativity.\n\nThis psychoanalytic dimension of Frankfurt School theory suggested that the obstacles to individual autonomy and revolutionary consciousness were not merely external—economic exploitation, political oppression, ideological manipulation—but also internal, rooted in the very structure of modern personality and the unconscious dynamics of modern social life. The critique of capitalism thus required not merely political and economic transformation but also cultural and psychological revolution that would create new forms of human personality capable of genuine freedom and creativity.\n\n## Althusser and Ideological State Apparatuses\n\nLouis Althusser's structuralist approach to Marxist theory provided yet another influential critique of liberal assumptions about individual agency and autonomous choice. Althusser argued that traditional Marxist approaches to ideology and consciousness remained too dependent on \"humanistic\" assumptions about individual subjectivity that needed to be eliminated in favor of a properly scientific understanding of how social structures determined human behavior.\n\nAlthusser's concept of \"ideological state apparatuses\" (ISAs) extended Gramsci's analysis of hegemony by identifying the specific institutional mechanisms through which capitalist societies reproduced the forms of consciousness necessary for their continued existence. Unlike \"repressive state apparatuses\" (police, military, courts) that maintained order through force, ideological state apparatuses (schools, churches, media, family) maintained order through the production of subjects who would voluntarily reproduce capitalist social relations.\n\nThe key insight of Althusser's analysis was that ideology did not simply consist of false ideas that could be corrected through better information or clearer thinking, but rather operated through material practices that shaped individual identity and social behavior. People became \"subjects\" of ideology not by consciously accepting particular beliefs, but by participating in social practices—attending school, going to church, consuming mass media, working for wages—that positioned them in particular ways within the social structure.\n\nThis Althusserian understanding of \"interpellation\"—the process by which individuals were \"hailed\" as subjects of particular ideological discourses—provided an even more radical critique of autonomous agency than previous Marxist approaches. Individual consciousness was not simply influenced or distorted by external social forces, but was actually constituted through ideological practices that created the very experience of being a free and autonomous subject. The liberal celebration of individual choice thus reflected not a recognition of genuine human capacity but rather the successful operation of ideological mechanisms that created the illusion of freedom while ensuring conformity to capitalist requirements.\n\nAlthusser's analysis suggested that there was literally no \"outside\" to ideology from which genuine critique or authentic choice could emerge. Even revolutionary consciousness was a product of particular ideological practices—reading Marx, participating in political organizations, engaging in collective struggle—rather than a recognition of objective truth that transcended ideological determination. This meant that revolutionary politics could not be based on appeals to authentic human nature or rational understanding of objective interests, but only on the development of alternative ideological practices that could compete successfully with dominant forms of subject formation.\n\nThe implications of this Althusserian approach for thinking about individual responsibility and political action were deeply paradoxical. On the one hand, it provided a more systematic and comprehensive critique of liberal individualism than any previous Marxist analysis. By showing how the very experience of individual agency was produced through ideological practices, it undermined liberal claims about autonomous choice at their deepest level. On the other hand, it made revolutionary politics appear almost impossible by eliminating any standpoint from which genuine critique or authentic resistance could emerge.\n\nAlthusser attempted to resolve this paradox by arguing that capitalist ideology was inherently contradictory and that these contradictions could be exploited by revolutionary movements to create alternative forms of subject formation. But his analysis provided little guidance about how such exploitation could occur or what would make alternative ideological practices more authentic than dominant ones. The result was a form of theoretical sophistication that seemed to paralyze rather than enable political action.\n\n## The Crisis of Revolutionary Subjectivity\n\nThe theoretical developments represented by Gramsci, the Frankfurt School, and Althusser all contributed to a growing crisis in Marxist thought about the possibility of revolutionary subjectivity and authentic individual agency. Each of these approaches provided more sophisticated accounts of how capitalist societies maintained themselves through cultural and psychological as well as economic means, but they also made it increasingly difficult to explain how genuine opposition or authentic choice could emerge from within such comprehensively controlled systems.\n\nThis crisis was intensified by historical developments that seemed to confirm the pessimistic implications of advanced Marxist theory. The integration of working-class movements into capitalist democracies through welfare state reforms and consumer prosperity appeared to validate analyses of hegemonic control and one-dimensional consciousness. The rise of fascist and Stalinist movements that claimed revolutionary legitimacy while creating new forms of totalitarian domination suggested that revolutionary politics might be inherently prone to authoritarian outcomes. The development of mass consumer culture and electronic media provided new mechanisms for social control that seemed to fulfill the darkest predictions of Frankfurt School theory.\n\nThe result was a gradual abandonment of revolutionary political goals by many Western Marxists in favor of more limited projects of cultural criticism and theoretical analysis. If revolutionary transformation was impossible under conditions of advanced capitalism, then the most that critical theory could accomplish was to maintain awareness of alternative possibilities and to resist the complete integration of consciousness into existing social arrangements. This defensive and pessimistic orientation represented a fundamental departure from the confident revolutionary optimism that had characterized earlier Marxist thought.\n\nThe crisis of revolutionary subjectivity also led to various attempts to discover new agents of social transformation that could replace the failed proletariat as bearers of universal human interests. Some theorists looked to racial and ethnic minorities, women, students, or Third World liberation movements as potential sources of revolutionary consciousness that had not been fully integrated into capitalist hegemony. Others turned to aesthetic experience, philosophical reflection, or spiritual practice as domains where authentic human experience might be preserved despite the totalizing tendencies of advanced capitalism.\n\nBut these alternative approaches generally reproduced the same theoretical problems that had undermined confidence in proletarian revolution. If hegemonic control was as pervasive as advanced Marxist theory suggested, why would any particular group be immune to its effects? If instrumental reason had corrupted all forms of modern consciousness, how could genuinely critical thinking emerge from within modern society? If ideological interpellation constituted individual subjectivity itself, what would authentic agency or revolutionary consciousness even mean?\n\n## The Postmodern Turn\n\nThe difficulties inherent in later socialist critiques of autonomy eventually contributed to the emergence of postmodern approaches to social theory that abandoned altogether the Marxist goal of revolutionary transformation in favor of more modest projects of local resistance and cultural subversion. Thinkers like Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, and Jean-François Lyotard drew on insights from advanced Marxist theory while rejecting its revolutionary political commitments and its confidence in the possibility of authentic human agency.\n\nFoucault's analysis of \"disciplinary power\" and \"biopower\" extended the Frankfurt School critique of instrumental reason by showing how modern societies controlled individuals not primarily through repression or ideology but through the production of forms of knowledge and subjectivity that made people complicit in their own domination. Modern institutions—hospitals, schools, prisons, factories—did not simply control behavior but actually created new forms of individual identity that internalized social control and made external coercion largely unnecessary.\n\nThis Foucauldian approach suggested that resistance to modern forms of power could not take the form of revolutionary transformation based on authentic human nature or objective class interests, because both human nature and class interests were themselves products of power relations rather than independent sources of critical perspective. Instead, resistance had to be local, tactical, and aimed at creating temporary spaces of freedom rather than permanent alternatives to existing social arrangements.\n\nDerrida's deconstruction of Western metaphysics provided another influential critique of traditional assumptions about autonomous subjectivity and rational agency. By showing how concepts like presence, identity, and self-consciousness were based on unstable philosophical foundations, deconstruction undermined confidence in the possibility of achieving genuine self-knowledge or authentic choice. Individual agency was revealed to be an effect of linguistic and cultural processes rather than a fundamental characteristic of human nature.\n\nLyotard's analysis of the \"postmodern condition\" extended this critique to grand narratives of human liberation, including both liberal and Marxist versions of emancipatory politics. In postmodern societies characterized by the breakdown of traditional authorities and the proliferation of incommensurable \"language games,\" neither individual autonomy nor collective revolution could provide adequate foundations for political action. The most that could be achieved was local and temporary agreements about specific issues rather than comprehensive solutions to fundamental problems.\n\n## The Contemporary Legacy\n\nThe later socialist critiques of autonomy have had profound and lasting influence on contemporary thinking about individual agency, even among those who reject their political conclusions. The insights that individual consciousness is shaped by cultural and institutional practices, that formal freedom can coexist with substantive control, and that modern societies operate through subtle forms of normalization rather than obvious coercion—all these ideas have become central to contemporary social analysis across a wide range of disciplines.\n\nContemporary discussions of \"social construction,\" \"cultural hegemony,\" and \"structural violence\" routinely employ concepts that derive from the tradition we have been examining. The recognition that individual choices are constrained by cultural expectations, institutional arrangements, and unconscious psychological processes has influenced everything from public health policy to educational reform to criminal justice practice. The understanding that power operates through the production of knowledge and subjectivity rather than merely through external coercion has transformed approaches to social work, therapy, and community organizing.\n\nBut the legacy of later socialist critiques has also created new forms of intellectual and political confusion that complicate contemporary efforts to address problems of inequality and oppression. The tendency to view all forms of individual agency as effects of social control can lead to deterministic analyses that eliminate space for personal responsibility and moral choice. The assumption that existing institutions are inherently oppressive can generate nihilistic or utopian political orientations that are poorly equipped to address practical problems. The rejection of universal principles in favor of local resistance can produce fragmented and ineffective opposition to genuine injustice.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the sophisticated critiques of autonomous agency developed by later socialist thinkers have never been adequately answered by defenders of liberal individualism. The mechanisms of social control and cultural hegemony that these theorists identified have generally become more rather than less sophisticated with the development of new technologies and institutional arrangements. The forms of false consciousness and manufactured consent that they analyzed have generally intensified rather than diminished with the growth of mass media and consumer culture.\n\nYet the political alternatives proposed by socialist critics have also proven problematic in both theory and practice. The attempt to create authentic forms of human agency through revolutionary transformation has generally resulted in new forms of authoritarianism rather than genuine liberation. The effort to resist modern forms of power through local and tactical opposition has generally failed to address systemic problems that require coordinated and sustained political action.\n\nUnderstanding both the insights and the limitations of later socialist critiques remains crucial for contemporary efforts to preserve valuable aspects of individual agency and self-reliance while addressing the structural problems that make their realization difficult under modern conditions. These critiques provide indispensable resources for understanding how individual consciousness is shaped by social conditions, but they do not provide adequate guidance for creating social conditions that would support rather than undermine genuine individual freedom and responsibility.\n\nThe challenge for contemporary political thought is to develop approaches that can acknowledge the real constraints on individual agency identified by socialist critics while preserving space for the personal choice and moral responsibility that remain essential for both individual flourishing and democratic governance. This may require abandoning both the naive optimism of liberal individualism and the revolutionary ambitions of traditional socialism in favor of more modest but sustainable approaches to social reform and individual development.\n\nThe later socialist tradition thus represents both an indispensable critique of liberal complacency about individual freedom and a cautionary tale about the intellectual and political dangers of pushing such critique to extremes. Understanding this complex legacy is essential for anyone seeking to navigate the continuing tensions between individual agency and social determination that remain central to contemporary moral and political life.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","reference-location":"block","output-file":"13_frankfurtschool.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

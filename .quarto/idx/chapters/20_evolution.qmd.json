{"title":"Evolution and the Limits of Rational Choice","markdown":{"headingText":"Evolution and the Limits of Rational Choice","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThe development of evolutionary psychology in the late twentieth century provided yet another scientific challenge to traditional assumptions about human rationality and autonomous choice, but one that operated at a different level than the neurological and psychological critiques we have examined. Where neuroscience questioned whether conscious will had any causal efficacy, and where psychology revealed systematic biases in human reasoning, evolutionary psychology suggested that the entire architecture of human cognition had been shaped by natural selection for survival and reproduction in ancestral environments rather than for the kinds of rational deliberation and moral choice that philosophical traditions had celebrated.\n\nAccording to evolutionary psychologists, the human mind was not a general-purpose reasoning device capable of objective analysis and autonomous choice, but rather a collection of specialized cognitive modules that had evolved to solve specific adaptive problems faced by hunter-gatherer ancestors. These mental modules operated according to principles that had been effective for survival and reproduction in small-scale ancestral societies but that often produced systematic errors and biases when applied to the complex moral, political, and economic problems of contemporary life.\n\nThis evolutionary perspective suggested that many of the cognitive limitations and moral failures that characterized human behavior were not accidental features that could be corrected through better education or social reform, but rather inevitable consequences of evolutionary history that could be managed but never eliminated. If human beings were naturally tribal, status-seeking, short-term oriented, and prone to various forms of cognitive bias, then ideals of rational self-government and universal moral concern might be utopian fantasies that ignored basic facts about human nature.\n\nYet evolutionary psychology also revealed remarkable human capacities for cultural learning, social cooperation, and moral reasoning that had enabled the development of complex civilizations and sophisticated moral systems. The same evolutionary processes that had produced cognitive limitations and tribal biases had also produced capacities for language, culture, and moral reasoning that allowed humans to transcend many of their biological limitations through social institutions and cultural evolution.\n\n## The Evolutionary Psychology Revolution\n\nThe emergence of evolutionary psychology as a distinct discipline in the 1980s and 1990s represented a fundamental shift in thinking about human nature and behavior. Earlier approaches to psychology had generally assumed that human cognition was highly flexible and could be shaped almost indefinitely through learning and social influence. Evolutionary psychologists argued instead that the human mind had a specific evolved architecture that constrained learning and behavior in systematic ways.\n\nThe basic insight of evolutionary psychology was that natural selection had shaped human cognitive and emotional capacities to solve the adaptive problems that had been recurrent throughout human evolutionary history. These adaptive problems included finding food, avoiding predators, selecting mates, caring for offspring, forming alliances, detecting cheaters, and navigating complex social hierarchies. The cognitive mechanisms that had evolved to solve these problems operated automatically and often unconsciously, influencing human perception, emotion, and decision-making in ways that people typically did not recognize.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists argued that many features of human psychology that seemed arbitrary or dysfunctional from a rational perspective actually made sense when understood as adaptations to ancestral environments. The human tendency to fear snakes and heights more than cars and electrical outlets reflected the relative dangers these posed in ancestral versus modern environments. The human preference for fatty and sugary foods reflected their scarcity and nutritional importance in hunter-gatherer societies rather than their abundance and health risks in contemporary societies.\n\nMore controversially, evolutionary psychologists also argued that many moral intuitions and social behaviors reflected evolutionary adaptations rather than rational deliberation about ethical principles. The tendency to favor family members over strangers, to form tribal loyalties, to be suspicious of outsiders, and to engage in reciprocal altruism all had clear adaptive functions in small-scale ancestral societies where reputation and kinship were crucial for survival and reproduction.\n\nThis evolutionary approach to human psychology had profound implications for thinking about rational choice and moral responsibility. If human behavior was largely driven by evolved psychological mechanisms that operated below the level of conscious awareness, then the assumption that people made rational choices based on careful deliberation about their interests and values became questionable. If moral intuitions reflected evolutionary adaptations rather than objective moral truths, then the assumption that moral reasoning could discover universal ethical principles became problematic.\n\nThe evolutionary challenge to rational choice was particularly acute because it suggested that irrationality was not simply an accidental feature of human psychology that could be corrected through better education or cognitive training. The biases and limitations that characterized human reasoning had been shaped by millions of years of natural selection and were therefore likely to be deeply entrenched and difficult to modify. Even when people recognized their cognitive biases, they might be unable to overcome them because such biases were built into the basic architecture of human cognition.\n\n## Cognitive Modules and Domain-Specific Reasoning\n\nOne of the most important insights of evolutionary psychology was that human cognition was not organized as a general-purpose reasoning system but rather as a collection of specialized cognitive modules that had evolved to solve specific adaptive problems. These modules operated according to different principles and processed information in different ways depending on the domain in question.\n\nFor example, humans appeared to have specialized cognitive modules for detecting cheaters in social exchange, recognizing faces, learning language, navigating spatial environments, and understanding the behavior of other minds. Each of these modules had its own characteristic patterns of operation and its own systematic biases and limitations. The module for detecting cheaters was extremely sensitive to violations of social contracts but relatively insensitive to violations of abstract logical rules. The module for face recognition was remarkably accurate for distinguishing among members of one's own ethnic group but showed systematic biases when applied to members of other ethnic groups.\n\nThis modular view of human cognition had important implications for thinking about moral reasoning and political judgment. If people used different cognitive modules for thinking about different types of problems, then the quality of their reasoning might vary dramatically depending on whether a problem activated modules that were well-adapted to the task at hand. People might be quite good at reasoning about reciprocal relationships and social obligations but quite poor at reasoning about statistical probabilities and abstract logical relationships.\n\nThe domain-specificity of human reasoning also suggested that many of the cognitive biases and errors that characterized human judgment might be confined to particular domains rather than reflecting general limitations in rational capacity. People who showed systematic biases when reasoning about abstract problems might be quite rational when reasoning about problems that were similar to those faced by their hunter-gatherer ancestors.\n\nBut the modular view of cognition also raised troubling questions about the possibility of objective moral and political reasoning. If moral intuitions were produced by specialized cognitive modules that had evolved to solve adaptive problems in ancestral environments, then such intuitions might be unreliable guides to moral truth in contemporary contexts. The moral emotions of disgust, anger, and compassion that seemed to provide the foundation for ethical judgment might reflect evolutionary adaptations rather than perceptions of objective moral reality.\n\nResearch by Jonathan Haidt and others suggested that moral judgments were typically made through rapid emotional responses that were then rationalized through post-hoc reasoning rather than through careful deliberation about moral principles. This suggested that much of what people experienced as moral reasoning was actually moral rationalization that served to justify conclusions that had already been reached through unconscious emotional processes.\n\n## Tribal Psychology and the Limits of Universal Concern\n\nPerhaps the most politically significant insight of evolutionary psychology concerned the tribal nature of human social psychology. Humans appeared to have evolved in small groups where cooperation with group members and competition with outsiders were both crucial for survival and reproduction. This evolutionary history had produced psychological mechanisms that facilitated in-group cooperation and loyalty while also promoting suspicion and hostility toward members of other groups.\n\nResearch on intergroup psychology revealed systematic patterns of in-group favoritism and out-group bias that operated even when group membership was based on arbitrary and meaningless distinctions. People showed preference for members of their own group in terms of resource allocation, moral evaluation, and causal attribution even when groups were formed randomly or based on trivial criteria like preference for abstract art styles.\n\nThese tribal biases had profound implications for thinking about moral and political ideals that emphasized universal human rights, global justice, and impartial concern for human welfare. If humans were naturally inclined to favor their own group members and to view outsiders with suspicion and hostility, then ideals of universal moral concern might conflict with deep-seated psychological tendencies that were difficult or impossible to overcome.\n\nThe evolutionary perspective on tribal psychology also suggested that many contemporary political conflicts might reflect the operation of evolved psychological mechanisms rather than rational disagreements about policy or values. Political partisanship, ethnic conflict, nationalism, and religious warfare might all represent modern expressions of ancient tribal psychology that had been adaptive in ancestral environments but that was dysfunctional in contemporary contexts where cooperation across group boundaries was necessary for addressing global challenges.\n\nSome evolutionary psychologists argued that understanding the tribal nature of human psychology could help in developing strategies for reducing intergroup conflict and promoting cooperation across group boundaries. If people naturally formed tribal loyalties based on shared identity and common threats, then it might be possible to expand the boundaries of moral concern by creating larger group identities and emphasizing common challenges that required cooperative responses.\n\nBut the tribal perspective also suggested that such efforts might face inherent psychological limitations that could not be easily overcome. If in-group favoritism and out-group bias were built into the basic architecture of human social cognition, then attempts to create universal moral concern might always remain fragile and vulnerable to activation of more primitive tribal instincts.\n\n## Status Competition and Hierarchical Thinking\n\nEvolutionary psychology also revealed the importance of status competition and hierarchical thinking in human social behavior. Humans appeared to have evolved in social groups that were characterized by dominance hierarchies where individual status was crucial for access to resources, mates, and social influence. This evolutionary history had produced psychological mechanisms that were highly sensitive to status relationships and that motivated individuals to compete for higher positions in social hierarchies.\n\nResearch on status psychology showed that humans were remarkably sensitive to subtle cues of social rank and that status considerations influenced behavior in ways that people often did not consciously recognize. People's sense of well-being, their health outcomes, and their social behavior were all significantly affected by their perceived position in social hierarchies, often more than by their absolute level of resources or achievement.\n\nThe evolutionary perspective on status competition had important implications for thinking about economic inequality and social justice. If humans were naturally motivated to compete for status and to seek higher positions in social hierarchies, then complete equality might be both impossible to achieve and psychologically unsatisfying even if it could be implemented. People might prefer unequal societies where they had opportunities for upward mobility to equal societies where such opportunities were absent.\n\nBut the evolutionary perspective on status also revealed the costs and irrationalities that characterized status competition. Much of human behavior that seemed wasteful or destructive from a rational perspective—conspicuous consumption, risky status displays, zero-sum competition for positional goods—made sense as strategies for signaling high status and attracting mates and allies. The same psychological mechanisms that motivated productive achievement and innovation also motivated wasteful arms races and destructive competition for relative position.\n\nThe status perspective also suggested that many political and moral ideologies might function partly as strategies for claiming or maintaining social status rather than as sincere attempts to promote human welfare or discover moral truth. People might adopt political positions that signaled their membership in high-status groups or that provided opportunities for moral superiority over others rather than positions that were most likely to achieve their stated goals.\n\n## The Evolution of Cooperation and Moral Emotions\n\nDespite the emphasis that evolutionary psychology placed on competition, tribal bias, and status seeking, the discipline also revealed remarkable human capacities for cooperation and moral behavior that had clearly evolved through natural selection. Humans were unique among animals in their ability to cooperate with large numbers of unrelated individuals, to follow abstract moral rules, and to make personal sacrifices for the welfare of others.\n\nResearch on the evolution of cooperation identified several mechanisms that could explain how natural selection had produced genuinely altruistic behavior. Kin selection favored behaviors that helped genetic relatives even at personal cost. Reciprocal altruism favored behaviors that helped others who were likely to return the favor in the future. Group selection favored behaviors that benefited the group even when they were costly to individuals, if groups with more cooperative members were more successful than groups with fewer cooperative members.\n\nThese evolutionary mechanisms had produced complex moral emotions like guilt, shame, gratitude, and indignation that served to regulate social behavior and promote cooperation even when immediate self-interest would dictate selfish behavior. The capacity for moral emotions appeared to be universal across human cultures and to emerge early in human development, suggesting that it was an evolved feature of human nature rather than a cultural invention.\n\nThe evolutionary perspective on moral emotions suggested that human moral capacity was both more robust and more limited than traditional philosophical approaches had assumed. More robust because moral motivation appeared to be grounded in evolved emotional mechanisms that operated automatically and powerfully rather than depending entirely on rational deliberation and conscious choice. More limited because these emotional mechanisms had evolved to promote cooperation within particular social contexts and might not generalize reliably to novel moral challenges.\n\nResearch on moral psychology also revealed systematic cultural variation in moral values and practices that suggested that while the capacity for moral behavior was universal, the specific content of moral systems was shaped by cultural evolution and social learning as well as by biological evolution. Different cultures emphasized different moral values—individual rights versus social harmony, purity versus tolerance, loyalty versus fairness—in ways that reflected their particular histories and social structures.\n\n## Cultural Evolution and Institutional Solutions\n\nOne of the most important insights emerging from evolutionary psychology was the recognition that human beings were capable of cultural learning and institutional innovation that could partially overcome the limitations imposed by evolved psychology. While humans were constrained by their evolved cognitive architecture, they were also uniquely capable of creating cultural institutions that could channel evolved motivations in constructive directions and compensate for evolved limitations.\n\nCultural evolution operated through mechanisms that were analogous to but distinct from biological evolution. Ideas, practices, and institutions that were successful in particular social environments were more likely to be copied and transmitted to future generations. This process of cultural selection could favor innovations that promoted cooperation, reduced conflict, and enhanced social welfare even when such innovations conflicted with immediate individual incentives.\n\nExamples of cultural innovations that had partially overcome evolved limitations included moral and legal systems that extended cooperation beyond tribal boundaries, economic institutions that channeled status competition into productive activities, and political institutions that provided peaceful methods for resolving conflicts and coordinating collective action. These cultural innovations did not eliminate evolved psychological tendencies but rather redirected them in ways that were more compatible with the requirements of large-scale social cooperation.\n\nThe coevolution of genes and culture had also produced uniquely human capacities for moral reasoning, cultural learning, and institutional innovation that went far beyond what would be expected based on evolved psychology alone. The human capacity for language, abstract reasoning, and symbolic thought had enabled the development of complex moral and political philosophies that could criticize existing institutions and motivate efforts at social reform.\n\nBut cultural evolution also faced inherent limitations imposed by evolved psychology. Cultural innovations that conflicted too strongly with evolved motivations were likely to be unstable and difficult to maintain over time. Institutions that ignored human tribal psychology, status motivations, and cognitive limitations were likely to fail or to produce unintended consequences that undermined their intended purposes.\n\nThe challenge for contemporary social organization was therefore to design institutions that could harness rather than ignore evolved human nature while channeling evolved motivations in directions that served contemporary needs and values. This required realistic understanding of human psychological limitations and capabilities as well as creative institutional design that could work with rather than against evolved human nature.\n\n## Implications for Self-Reliance and Individual Responsibility\n\nThe evolutionary perspective on human psychology had complex and sometimes contradictory implications for thinking about self-reliance and individual responsibility. On the one hand, evolutionary psychology revealed systematic limitations in human reasoning and decision-making that suggested that individuals might not be as capable of rational self-direction as traditional liberal theory assumed. If human behavior was largely driven by evolved psychological mechanisms that operated below the level of conscious awareness, then the ideal of autonomous rational choice might be based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human nature.\n\nOn the other hand, evolutionary psychology also revealed remarkable human capacities for learning, adaptation, and self-modification that suggested that individuals possessed significant potential for personal growth and behavioral change. The human capacity for cultural learning, moral reasoning, and conscious self-regulation went far beyond what was found in other animals and provided foundations for meaningful forms of individual agency and responsibility.\n\nThe evolutionary perspective suggested that self-reliance and individual responsibility were both more and less important than traditional philosophical approaches had assumed. More important because individual choices and commitments played crucial roles in shaping personal development and social outcomes, even when such choices were constrained by evolved psychology and social circumstances. Less important because individual agency operated within biological and cultural constraints that limited the range of possible choices and outcomes.\n\nThe challenge for contemporary thinking about self-reliance was to develop approaches that could acknowledge both the constraints and the possibilities revealed by evolutionary psychology. This required abandoning naive assumptions about unlimited human plasticity and rational choice while preserving recognition of the real differences that individual choices and commitments could make within the constraints of evolved human nature.\n\nUnderstanding the evolutionary basis of human psychology also suggested new strategies for promoting individual responsibility and social cooperation that worked with rather than against evolved human nature. Educational approaches that appealed to evolved moral emotions, institutional designs that channeled status competition into productive activities, and social policies that recognized human tribal psychology while promoting broader forms of cooperation might be more effective than approaches that ignored evolutionary insights about human motivation and behavior.\n\nThe evolutionary legacy thus represented both an important correction to overly optimistic assumptions about human rationality and moral capacity and a valuable source of insights about how to design social institutions and personal practices that could enhance rather than undermine human flourishing within the constraints of evolved human nature. Its continuing influence reflected both the power of evolutionary thinking for understanding human behavior and the ongoing challenge of applying such insights to the practical problems of contemporary life.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","reference-location":"block","output-file":"20_evolution.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

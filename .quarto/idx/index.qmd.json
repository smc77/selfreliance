When these are voluntary we receive praise and blame; when involuntary, we are pardoned and sometimes pitied.  Therefore, it is, I dare say, indispensable for a student of virtue to differentiate between voluntary and involuntary actions, and useful also for lawgivers, to help them in meting out honors and punishments. - Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book 3\n\n> Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self...Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. - Emerson, \"Self-Reliance\"\n\n> The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs... J.S. Mill, On Liberty\n\n[Quote from \"Free to Choose\"]\n\nIt has become fashionable to find esoteric explanations for human progress, to shun the standard canon.  But it is often the case that occam's razor applies, and the simplest explanation is also the best.\n\n\n\n## Responsibility is not Anarchistic\n\nSaying that self-reliance is an important virtue is not to say that every possible path is equally good.  This is one of the inherent tensions in public life.  Being able to thrive individually means making good choices that fit within your character and within society.\n\n\n## Character\n\nWhat does it mean to be authentic?  \n\nThriving as an individual requires a sense of realism.  The advice to the young to \"follow your passion\" or \"shoot for the stars\" \n\n\n## Self-Knowledge and Education\n\nUnderlying self-reliance is a clear-eyed understanding of the self, along with a belief in the possibility of self-improvement.  \n\n\n## Emerson\n\nPerhaps no one is more closely associated with *self-reliance* than Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\n\n## Free to Choose\n\nBook III of the Nicomachean Ethics (@aristotle1985) reflects extensively on the tight connection between virtue and voluntary action.  \n\nAt the heart of the libertarian philosophy is *choice*, yet underpinning our affection for choosing is an unseen framework of beliefs.  Within J.S. Mill's \n\nHaving regret is a feeling that *we could have done otherwise*.\n\n[Story about man with brain damage who committed murder.]\n\nIn statistics, we talk about a *counter factual*.  \n\n## Coercion, with good intentions \n\nThe tyranny of experts and iatrogenic harm.  Example of shoe company that donates shoes, killing local businesses.\n\nForeign aid vs. non-profit sector.\n\nIn modern America, there is a \"pro choice\" movement which emphasizes that women should have control over their own bodies, and have the right to an abortion.  Is this a clear example of the virtue of agency?  Not necessarily, as the counter argument runs that this violates the choice of the unborn child to live, and so the determination of where the agency lies depends on a definition of when life begins, and that is a question of custom.\n\nWhat about an old person's decision to have an assisted suicide?  \n\n## Individuals and Groups\n\nIt hasn't always been the case that individuals possessed a sense of agency.  (@siedentop2014)\n\nEven today, there's a huge gap between the West and the rest of the world. (@henrich2020)\n\n\n## Agency and Responsibility\n\nWhat does it mean to have responsibility for your actions?  \n\nDoes a person bear *more* responsibility if they are more intelligent?  \n\n\n## Extreme Ownership\n\nJocko Wilik\nDaring Greatly by Brené Brown\n\n\n**Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win by Jocko Willink & Leif Babin (2015)\nA bestselling leadership guide grounded in battlefield lessons. Emphasizes total personal accountability—“no excuses”—for teams and individuals \n\n**The Dichotomy of Leadership by Jocko Willink\nA tactical follow-up that balances disciplined “extreme ownership” with empowering and humility—tension at the heart of strong leadership \n\n\n**Practical Self‑Reliance by John D. McCann\nA down-to-earth guide to reducing dependency—covering food, energy, financial, and emergency prep for modern living.\n\n**The Ultimate Self‑Sufficiency Manual (Outdoor Life) by Tim MacWelch\nPacked with over 220 practical tips and survival strategies designed to build autonomy in a complex world.\n\nTaking Responsibility: Self‑Reliance and the Accountable Life (Nathaniel Branden)\nEmphasizes self-realization through disciplined personal accountability and moral integrity \n\nBootstrapped: Liberating Ourselves from the American Dream (Alissa Quart, 2023)\nCritiques the myth of the self‑made individual and rethinks autonomy in light of structural realities \n\nPassion Struck (John R. Miles, 2024)\nHighlights experiential, purposeful living—combining personal mission with leadership and choice \n\nThe Let Them Theory (Mel Robbins, 2025)\nA best-selling self-help title encouraging agency by focusing only on what we can control, liberating ourselves from external pressures \n\n\n## Community and Bowling Alone\n\n\nTaking personal responsibility *comes first*.  \n\nThis is not to say that community and connection are unimportant.  Sometimes we need help.  One of the most important lessons in Economics is the division of labor.  That division of labor runs all the way down, such that it's entirely impossible for an individual to research every topic in depth and we must rely on expertise in every dimension of our lives.\n\n\n## The Challenge\n\nSelf-reliance is a Western, but a uniquely Amerian idea as we will aim to show.  \n\nFrom the nation's founding, there has always been a tension between \n\nCoddling of the American Mind\n\nThe Horseshoe Theory https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory\n\nOn the Left, Wokism .  Cancel culture, ...\n\nOn the Right, religious conservatives ban books on topics that they find repulsive, such as transgenderism.  ... Protectionism\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","reference-location":"block","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

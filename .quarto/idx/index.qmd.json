When these are voluntary we receive praise and blame; when involuntary, we are pardoned and sometimes pitied.

It argues that what comes first matters, what underlies our systems influences everything above it.  \n\nThis book is both a book of philosophical discussion, while also being within the genre of a History of Ideas. History of Ideas consider not just the philosophical works, but also the context that led to their invention along with the connections between the different schools of thought.  My intention is to make clear that these ideas have real world consequences.  \n\nWhen Descartes declared \"I think therefore I am\", he was fundamentally putting Man at the center of his universe.  This i what I mean by being individual-first.  After we peal back politics, culture, and even our familes, we are left by ourselves in the world.\n\nThis comes down to the appropriate *frame of reference*.  (Sean Carroll, quantum...). Our perceptions are ultimately built on stories that we tell ourselves. \n\nWe can distinguish between *instincts* and *habits*, even though both are immediate.\n\nThe free enterprise system rests on a system of laws, not the least of which apply to contracts; markets don't exist in a vacuum.\n\nOur laws sit on top of a cultural edifice.  \n\nSelf-reliance relies on:\n\n* The existence of a self\n* Free will\n\nWe take these things for granted in that if everything is fully determined, if we are not truly the arbiters of our own choices, then \n\nVoluntary action should sit at the heart of our awareness.  Throughout our experiences, we should ask \"what did I choose\" rather than \"what happened to me\".  Life is about action.\n\n\nThe communitarian perspective comes from a different world view.  Man was never naturally alone.\n\n\nThroughout most of civilized human history, people were raised around *klans*, and this is still the norm.\n\n\nSo when we come from the individual-first worldview, we realize that the first question should be *what is my responsibility*.  We ask questions like *how can I live better* first, then questions like *how can I improve my community*.  The community-first perspective gravitates towards paternalism and totalitarianism.  \n\n\nAnother underlying belief of this author is that we should not ignore common sense wisdom. \n\n* G.E.Moore *A Defence of Common Sense* (1925)\n* Thomas Reid *Scottish Common Sense Realism*\n* Michael Polanyi *Personal Knowledge* (1958) and *The Tacit Dimension* (1966)\n\n* Critique: Churchland, w.r.t. folk psychology.\n\nWhat a common sense assessment should make clear is that culture is an optional facade.  All of our institutions, while undoubtedly important, are transient and can be removed.  But as individuals, we are the ultimate arbiters of our lives.\n\nMarx was wrong.  We are not primarily members of a class.\n\n[The movie \"Trading Places\"]\n\n\nOther themes:\n\n* Naturalism, self-sufficiency (Cameron Hanes)\n\n\nBeing self-reliant does not mean being epistemologically relativistic. We are responsible for making the *right* choices.\n\n\nI should also make clear: when I say that human agency is primary, that does not mean that we should ignore experts. But when we are in doctor's office and they recommend a treatment, we should just know that we have an active role to play in the decision. We live with the consequences. While its foolhardy to expect that we can make equally informed decisions as experts, we still make decisions. \n\nIt's also important to know the boundaries of expertise. A macro economist is not the same kind of expert as a electrician because the domains of expertise differ in their capacity for elucidation. \n\nWhen a public health official is making a decision that schools should be closed because of a pandemic, they should be taken seriously about the risks of spreading infections and the potential for harm. But they don't necessarily know the impact that the closed schools will have on the psychology and emotional development of the children, not the decreased productivity of parents and businesses that need to manage their children outside of the normal support systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are three voices across twenty-three centuries, united by a conviction that would have seemed bizarre to most of human history: that there exists something morally precious about actions that flow from genuine choice rather than external compulsion. This is not merely a philosophical curiosity—it is the foundation upon which our entire system of moral evaluation rests. When we feel regret, we experience it as evidence that we *could have done otherwise*. When courts assign punishment, they distinguish between voluntary and involuntary acts. When we praise courage or condemn cowardice, we assume that the agent possessed genuine alternatives.\n\nYet this conviction—that voluntary choice is morally superior to coerced action—has never been more embattled than it is today. From every quarter come challenges to its foundations: religious critics who insist that fallen humanity requires divine grace, political theorists who reveal how social structures constrain individual agency, scientists who demonstrate that consciousness itself may be largely illusory. The question confronting us is whether anything remains of this ancient ideal under modern conditions, and whether it deserves to remain.\n\n## I. The Heart of the Moral Universe\n\nIt has become fashionable among intellectuals to seek esoteric explanations for human progress, to deconstruct the \"narratives\" upon which civilization rests. But perhaps the simplest explanation remains the truest: that societies which honor voluntary choice tend to flourish, while those that crush it tend to stagnate. The remarkable prosperity and freedom of the modern West did not emerge by accident—they are the fruit of ideas, particular ideas about the moral significance of individual agency.\n\nBook III of Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* (@aristotle1985) reflects extensively on what the philosopher saw as the intimate connection between virtue and voluntary action. For Aristotle, moral praise and blame made sense only when applied to actions that were genuinely chosen—performed with knowledge of the circumstances, originating from the agent's own will, and free from external compulsion. This insight, seemingly obvious to modern ears, was revolutionary in its implications: it suggested that the capacity for voluntary choice was what made human beings distinctively moral creatures.\n\nAt the heart of what Milton and Rose Friedman called \"the libertarian philosophy\" lies this same recognition: that *choice* itself possesses moral value, quite apart from the particular choices made. Yet underpinning our affection for choosing is what they called \"an unseen framework of beliefs\"—assumptions about human nature, moral responsibility, and the conditions necessary for authentic existence that can no longer be taken for granted.\n\n## II. The Fragility of Agency\n\nConsider the tragic case of Charles Whitman, that methodical engineer who in 1966 murdered his wife and mother before ascending the University of Texas tower to kill sixteen strangers. During his autopsy, doctors discovered a brain tumor pressing against his amygdala—the region associated with impulse control and emotional regulation. Whitman himself had suspected something was wrong; his suicide note requested that \"an autopsy would be performed on me to see if there is any visible physical disorder.\"\n\nHere we encounter the modern predicament in its starkest form: if Whitman's tumor explains his actions, where lies moral responsibility? Yet if we excuse Whitman, what of the millions whose behavior is shaped by genetics, childhood trauma, social conditioning—forces equally beyond their choosing? In statistics, we construct *counterfactuals* to test causal relationships, but these assume that alternative outcomes were genuinely possible. If determinism is true, such assumptions may be illusory.\n\nThis is not merely an abstract philosophical problem. Every day, courts must decide whether defendants possessed the capacity for voluntary action. Every moral judgment assumes that agents could have chosen differently. Every assignment of praise or blame presupposes what philosophers call \"the principle of alternative possibilities.\" Yet contemporary science seems to chip away steadily at the foundations of this principle.\n\n## III. Responsibility Without Anarchy\n\nTo defend the moral importance of voluntary choice is emphatically *not* to embrace what Karl Popper called \"the myth of the framework\"—the notion that any choice is as good as any other. This represents one of the deepest tensions in liberal thought: how to honor individual agency while acknowledging that some choices are objectively better than others, some forms of life more worthy than others, some moral convictions more soundly based than others.\n\nThe mistake lies in supposing that respect for individual choice requires moral relativism. On the contrary, genuine choice becomes meaningful only within frameworks that distinguish between good and bad, noble and base, authentic and inauthentic ways of living. As John Stuart Mill understood, \"The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way\"—but this presupposes that there is such a thing as \"our own good\" to be pursued, and that some ways of pursuing it are superior to others.\n\nThis is why the contemporary tendency to tell young people simply to \"follow your passion\" or \"shoot for the stars\" represents a profound betrayal of the educational mission. Authentic self-reliance requires not the absence of external guidance but the right kind of guidance—that which develops rather than diminishes our capacities for wise choice. What the ancients called *character* emerges not from unlimited freedom but from disciplined engagement with demanding standards of excellence.\n\n## IV. The Mystery of Authenticity\n\nWhat does it mean to be authentic? The question has plagued Western thought since Rousseau proclaimed the natural goodness of the human heart. Yet the more closely we examine the notion of an \"authentic self,\" the more problematic it becomes. Which self are we to trust—the self that desires or the self that reflects? The self that acts or the self that judges action? The self that exists at this moment or the self that persists through time?\n\nEmerson, that most American of philosophers, offered one answer: \"Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.\" For Emerson, authenticity meant listening to what he called \"the inward voice\"—that mysterious capacity for moral insight that he believed all human beings possessed. \"To believe your own thought,\" he wrote in his essay \"Self-Reliance,\" \"to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men—that is genius.\"\n\nYet Emerson's confidence in individual moral intuition reflected assumptions about human nature that contemporary psychology has called into question. If our deepest convictions are shaped by unconscious forces, social conditioning, and cognitive biases we cannot recognize, what reason do we have to trust the \"inward voice\"? The romantic notion of natural goodness has given way to a more tragic understanding of human nature—one that recognizes both our capacity for moral insight and our systematic tendencies toward self-deception.\n\n## V. The Paradox of Moral Development\n\nHere we encounter what might be called the central paradox of moral education: the very capacity for authentic choice that we seek to develop can only be developed through experiences that limit choice. The child who is never required to do anything difficult never develops the strength to choose difficulty when it matters. The student who is never exposed to demanding standards never acquires the discrimination to recognize excellence. The citizen who is never held accountable for poor decisions never develops the judgment necessary for good ones.\n\nThis insight runs counter to much contemporary thinking about human development. Progressive educational theory, influenced by romantic notions about natural goodness, has often treated external constraints—disciplinary requirements, academic standards, moral expectations—as obstacles to authentic development rather than as necessary conditions for it. The result has been what Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt call \"the coddling of the American mind\"—the production of young people who are less resilient, less capable of independent thought, more vulnerable to emotional manipulation than previous generations.\n\nYet the alternative is not authoritarian indoctrination but what we might call *educative authority*—the kind of guidance that develops rather than diminishes human capacities for choice. As the philosopher Michael Oakeshott understood, genuine education involves initiation into what he called \"the conversation of mankind\"—the ongoing dialogue about human purposes and possibilities that constitutes civilization itself.\n\n## VI. The Social Foundations of Individual Agency\n\nOne of the deepest insights of modern social science is the recognition that individual agency, far from being natural or inevitable, requires particular social conditions to flourish. Taking personal responsibility may come *first* in the moral sense, but it emerges *last* in the developmental sense—only after individuals have been nurtured within communities that provide both support and accountability.\n\nThis insight helps explain what Robert Putnam called the \"bowling alone\" phenomenon—the decline of social capital in American society. As traditional intermediary institutions—families, churches, civic associations, local communities—have weakened, individuals have gained formal freedom while losing the social contexts that make meaningful choice possible. One of the most important lessons of economics is the division of labor, but this lesson extends beyond material production to moral and intellectual development. No individual can research every topic in depth; we must rely on networks of trust and expertise in every dimension of our lives.\n\nYet this dependence need not compromise individual agency if it is the right kind of dependence—what we might call *dignified* rather than *degrading* dependence. The difference lies not in the extent of our reliance on others but in whether that reliance develops or diminishes our own capacities for judgment and choice.\n\n## VII. The Challenge of Coercion with Good Intentions\n\nPerhaps the most insidious threat to voluntary choice in the modern world comes not from obvious tyranny but from what might be called \"coercion with good intentions\"—the systematic undermining of individual agency by those who claim to be helping. The phenomenon is visible everywhere: in international development programs that create dependency rather than prosperity, in educational policies that prioritize self-esteem over achievement, in therapeutic approaches that encourage victimhood rather than responsibility.\n\nConsider the example of well-meaning organizations that donate shoes to impoverished communities in developing countries. The immediate recipients benefit from free footwear, but local shoe-making businesses are destroyed, creating long-term dependency rather than sustainable development. This represents what economists call \"iatrogenic harm\"—damage caused by the very interventions intended to help.\n\nSimilar dynamics operate throughout contemporary society. Foreign aid programs that undermine local capacity for self-governance. Educational systems that protect students from challenge and failure. Therapeutic cultures that teach people to see themselves as victims of forces beyond their control. In each case, the intention is benevolent, but the effect is to diminish rather than enhance human agency.\n\nThe pattern reflects what Thomas Sowell has called \"the vision of the anointed\"—the assumption that complex human problems can be solved by credentialed experts who understand people's \"real\" interests better than they understand themselves. This vision, however well-intentioned, represents a fundamental assault on human dignity, for it denies the very capacity for self-direction that makes us distinctively human.\n\n## VIII. Questions of Life and Death\n\nThe moral complexity surrounding voluntary choice becomes particularly acute when we consider questions of life and death. The contemporary \"pro-choice\" movement emphasizes that women should have control over their own bodies and reproductive decisions—an apparent example of the virtue of individual agency. Yet critics argue that this framework ignores the moral status of the unborn, whose own \"choice\" to live is eliminated by abortion. The determination of where legitimate agency lies depends on contested questions about when morally significant life begins—questions that cannot be resolved through appeals to individual choice alone.\n\nSimilar complexities arise around end-of-life decisions. An elderly person's desire for physician-assisted suicide appears to represent the ultimate expression of individual autonomy—the choice to determine the timing and manner of one's own death. Yet such decisions occur within contexts of family relationships, medical systems, and cultural expectations that may constrain genuine choice in subtle ways. The supposedly \"autonomous\" decision may actually reflect internalized pressure to avoid being a burden, depression that could be treated, or inadequate palliative care that makes continued life seem unbearable.\n\nThese examples illustrate why simplistic appeals to individual choice are insufficient for navigating complex moral terrain. Meaningful voluntary action requires not just the formal freedom to choose, but also the intellectual resources to understand one's situation, the moral framework to evaluate options, and the social support to make choices that are genuinely one's own rather than products of manipulation or desperation.\n\n## IX. Intelligence and Moral Responsibility\n\nThese complexities are compounded when we consider individual differences in cognitive capacity and moral development. Does a person bear *more* responsibility for their actions if they are more intelligent? Should we expect the same level of moral behavior from someone with an IQ of 85 as from someone with an IQ of 135? How do we account for differences in education, cultural background, and life experience when evaluating individual choices?\n\nContemporary criminal justice increasingly grapples with such questions as advances in neuroscience and psychology reveal the biological and social factors that influence behavior. Yet abandoning notions of individual responsibility altogether would undermine the foundations of both legal systems and moral evaluation. The challenge is to develop more nuanced approaches that can acknowledge limitations on human agency while preserving space for meaningful choice and accountability.\n\nPopular works like Jocko Willink's *Extreme Ownership* advocate taking complete personal responsibility for all outcomes, arguing that this mindset leads to better performance and greater resilience. The subtitle of his book with Leif Babin promises to show \"How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win\" through total personal accountability. Brené Brown's *Daring Greatly* similarly emphasizes personal responsibility while acknowledging the importance of vulnerability and social connection. These approaches reflect a recognition that extreme individualism and extreme collectivism are both inadequate—that healthy human development requires both personal responsibility and social support.\n\n## X. The Historical Achievement\n\nThe ideal of individual agency has not always existed, nor does it exist everywhere today. As Larry Siedentop demonstrates in *Inventing the Individual* (@siedentop2014), the very notion that persons possess inherent dignity independent of their social roles emerged gradually from Christian theological reflection and was only later secularized by Enlightenment thinkers. For most of human history, people understood themselves primarily as bearers of roles—son, warrior, priest—rather than as autonomous agents.\n\nEven today, as Joseph Henrich shows in *The WEIRDest People in the World* (@henrich2020), there remains a huge gap between the West and the rest of the world in assumptions about individual agency and moral responsibility. What seems natural and obvious to Americans and Europeans—the importance of personal choice, individual rights, self-expression—appears strange or even harmful to many other cultures.\n\nThis historical and cultural variation raises important questions about the universality of ideals we take for granted. Yet it also suggests that the development of individual agency represents a genuine achievement rather than a mere cultural preference—an expansion of human possibilities that, once glimpsed, proves difficult to abandon.\n\n## XI. The Contemporary Crisis\n\nToday we witness what might be called the \"horseshoe convergence\" of seemingly opposed political movements, both of which represent, in different ways, a loss of confidence in individual agency. From the progressive left comes an emphasis on structural oppression that often treats personal responsibility as a cruel myth designed to justify inequality. Advocates speak of \"systemic racism,\" \"food deserts,\" and \"school-to-prison pipelines\"—frameworks that reduce individual behavior to the predictable products of social forces.\n\nFrom the conservative right comes a different but related paternalism. Religious leaders who preach personal responsibility seek to ban books that might expose young people to challenging ideas about topics like transgenderism. Economic nationalists who champion \"free markets\" support protectionist policies that shield domestic industries and workers from international competition. Cultural traditionalists advocate censorship and control in the name of protecting virtue.\n\nBoth tendencies reflect what the political scientist Steven Levitsky has called \"the exhaustion of liberalism\"—the loss of confidence in the capacity of ordinary people to evaluate information, make decisions, and bear responsibility for the consequences. Whether motivated by progressive compassion or conservative concern, the result is the same: the replacement of individual judgment with expert guidance, of personal responsibility with institutional management.\n\nThe \"Coddling of the American Mind,\" as Lukianoff and Haidt document, extends beyond university campuses to encompass broader cultural patterns. Students arrive at college having been carefully protected from intellectual challenge, emotional discomfort, and the possibility of failure. They have been taught to trust their feelings rather than develop their reasoning, to see themselves as fragile victims rather than resilient agents capable of growth through struggle.\n\n## XII. The Path Forward\n\nYet the solution is not to abandon the insights of modern psychology and sociology, but to integrate them with a mature understanding of human agency. We are neither gods nor puppets, but something more complex and more interesting: beings capable of limited but genuine choice within constraints that are themselves partly of our making.\n\nThe key insight of the liberal tradition—stretching from Aristotle through Mill to our own day—remains valid: human dignity requires the capacity for self-direction, however imperfectly realized. But applying this insight wisely requires what Aristotle called *phronesis*—practical wisdom of a high order. We must learn to distinguish between constraints that enhance human agency and those that diminish it, between authority that educates and authority that indoctrinates, between communities that support individual development and those that enforce conformity.\n\nThis is not merely a matter of applying abstract principles but of making concrete judgments about particular situations—the kind of judgment that can only be developed through practice, reflection, and engagement with inherited traditions of moral and political wisdom. It requires what we might call \"tragic wisdom\"—the recognition that we cannot have everything we want, that every choice involves sacrifice, that even our best efforts will be imperfect.\n\n## XIII. Community and Individual Agency\n\nThe recognition that individual agency requires social support leads to what might seem a paradox: genuine self-reliance is impossible without community. But this is only a paradox if we conceive of independence as total self-sufficiency—an impossible and undesirable goal. True independence consists rather in what we might call \"confident interdependence\"—the ability to contribute meaningfully to social cooperation while maintaining one's own judgment and moral compass.\n\nRobert Putnam's documentation of \"bowling alone\"—the decline of social capital in American society—reveals one of the crucial challenges facing contemporary democracy. As traditional intermediary institutions have weakened, individuals have gained formal freedom while losing the social contexts that make meaningful choice possible. The result is often not liberation but isolation, not empowerment but anxiety.\n\nYet the answer is not nostalgic retreat to traditional forms of community that may no longer be viable under contemporary conditions. Rather, it is the creative development of new forms of association that can provide both individual opportunity and social solidarity. This requires moving beyond the false choice between atomistic individualism and suffocating conformity toward what the political theorist Robert Bellah called \"genuine community\"—associations that enhance rather than diminish individual agency while serving collective purposes.\n\n## XIV. The Argument of This Book\n\nThe intellectual history that follows traces the development of ideas about voluntary choice and individual responsibility through twenty-five centuries of Western thought. It is a story of remarkable creativity and persistent struggle—creativity in imagining new possibilities for human freedom and dignity, struggle to preserve these possibilities against forces that would reduce persons to mere products of nature, society, or divine decree.\n\nThe story reveals both the achievements and the limitations of the Western intellectual tradition. That tradition has generated unprecedented prosperity, freedom, and human development. It has also produced the instruments of its own critique, undermining the theological and metaphysical foundations on which its achievements originally rested. Whether these achievements can be preserved and extended under contemporary conditions remains an open question.\n\nWhat is certain is that the question matters. The capacity for voluntary choice and moral responsibility may be limited, constrained, and imperfectly realized—but it remains one of the most precious achievements of human civilization. To treat it as merely an illusion, a cultural preference, or an ideological mystification is to abandon something essential to human dignity itself.\n\nAs we shall see, preserving this capacity will require intellectual honesty about its limitations, moral courage in defending its importance, and practical wisdom in creating social conditions that support rather than undermine authentic human agency. The ideal of self-reliance, properly understood, is not the enemy of community but its necessary foundation—for only beings capable of genuine choice can enter into the kind of voluntary associations that make civilized life possible.\n\nThe conversation that began in ancient Athens continues in our own time, as each generation must discover anew what it means to be both free and responsible, both individual and social, both modern and heir to ancient wisdom. Whether the ideal of voluntary choice can survive the challenges of scientific materialism, therapeutic culture, and political polarization remains to be seen. The answer will depend not merely on intellectual argument but on the practical choices made by individuals and communities in their daily lives.\n\nIn this sense, the question of self-reliance is not merely historical or philosophical but urgently contemporary—a challenge that tests whether democratic societies can maintain the moral and intellectual resources necessary for their own survival and flourishing.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","reference-location":"block","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

# Virtue and Voluntariness in Ancient Greece

In our quest to understand the origins of self-reliance and authenticity, we begin not with modern psychology or liberal politics, but with the ethical theories of the ancient Greeks. For thinkers like Aristotle and the Stoics, the question of what makes an action virtuous was inseparable from the conditions under which that action is chosen. Their emphasis on rationality, agency, and moral responsibility offers one of the earliest articulations of the idea that true virtue must be freely chosen, not imposed.

## Aristotle: Voluntariness and Moral Responsibility

In Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics* \[@aristotle1985], the idea of moral agency hinges on voluntariness. An action is only considered truly virtuous if it is done knowingly and without external compulsion. Aristotle distinguishes between involuntary actions (those done under coercion or through ignorance) and voluntary actions (those chosen with awareness and intent). Virtue, for him, is not innate or accidental, but a state of character that arises from habitually choosing the good. Moral development, then, is a matter of practice—*hexis*—a stable disposition to act well that emerges only through repeated, conscious choices.

> "Every virtue is both produced and destroyed by the same cause, and so too is every art. It is from doing just actions that the just man is produced" (NE II.1).

This framework creates the foundation for moral responsibility. A coerced or manipulated action, even if it results in a good outcome, lacks the moral integrity of an action chosen freely. Aristotle emphasizes that only when we act voluntarily and from a settled disposition can we be truly praised or blamed.

The implications for self-reliance are profound: to be virtuous, one must not only understand the good but be capable of choosing it for oneself. This emphasis on deliberate, autonomous action makes Aristotle one of the earliest proponents of a proto-authentic ideal—one grounded not in self-expression, but in disciplined self-governance.

## The Stoics: Inner Freedom as Mastery

While Aristotle roots virtue in habituated choice that arises through social training and practical wisdom (*phronesis*), the Stoics push the idea of agency even further inward. For Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius, the domain of freedom lies not in what we do, but in how we respond to the world. What truly belongs to us is our judgment, our assent, our intention.

Epictetus, a former slave turned moral philosopher, teaches that we must learn to distinguish between what is in our power and what is not. His *Discourses* and *Enchiridion* emphasize that our true freedom consists in mastering the will:

> “Some things are up to us and some are not. Up to us are our opinions, impulses, desires, aversions—in short, whatever is our own doing” \[@epictetus2008].

Seneca echoes this view when he writes:

> “The wise man is free, even if he is a slave; the fool is a slave, even if he is a king.”

Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor and philosopher, offers a more meditative formulation of this idea in his *Meditations*:

> "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."

Together, these Stoics emphasize a model of authenticity as **consistency between reason and will**, rather than external expression or originality. The authentic person is one who conforms to the rational order of the cosmos, who accepts their fate (*amor fati*), and whose freedom lies in their interior assent. This is a very different ideal from the modern valorization of creative individualism, but it shares with later ideas of self-reliance the belief that freedom must begin with the self.

## Freedom, Praise, and the Ethical Agent

A key theme uniting Aristotle and the Stoics is the importance of **voluntary action** in assigning moral praise or blame. This concern is not merely practical or legal—it is metaphysical. To be a moral agent is to be the kind of being who can deliberate, choose, and take responsibility.

Aristotle argues in NE III.1 that if humans did not act voluntarily, we would not praise the courageous or blame the cowardly. The very concepts of ethics and politics depend on the presumption that we can act otherwise—that our choices are not wholly determined by fate or instinct. Similarly, the Stoics, despite their belief in a deterministic cosmos, insist on the moral necessity of assent. We do not choose what happens, but we choose how we respond.

This principle—that the moral life begins in **voluntary choice**—echoes centuries later in Christian thinkers like Augustine and Aquinas, is reinterpreted by Kant, and remains foundational in modern ethics and legal thought. What the ancients make clear is that a moral life is not simply one in which good is done—it is one in which the good is **chosen**, knowingly and freely.

## Toward a Philosophy of the Self

The emphasis on deliberation, consent, and internal self-rule in ancient Greek thought lays the groundwork for later ideas of **moral autonomy**, **personal responsibility**, and ultimately the **modern ideal of self-reliance**. Before there can be an Emersonian exhortation to “trust thyself,” there must first be a conception of the self as **capable of choosing** wisely and freely.

What we find in Aristotle and the Stoics is not yet the full-fledged individualism of modern liberalism, but rather a rigorous vision of the moral subject as an agent—one who must actively shape their character and who bears responsibility for their choices. As we move forward in this intellectual history, we will see how this ancient ideal evolves: challenged by theological determinism, reasserted by Enlightenment autonomy, and eventually reshaped by the modern demand for authenticity, expression, and self-invention.

### **Chapter 1: Virtue and Voluntariness in Ancient Greece**  
**Between the Polis and the Inner Citadel**  

#### **I. The Athenian Paradox: Freedom as Obedience**  
The question we confront is not whether the Greeks believed in what we now call "self-reliance"—this would be to commit the cardinal sin of *anachronism*, that "chronological snobbery" (as C.S. Lewis called it) which distorts the past by the light of the present. Rather, we must ask: *What kind of freedom did they imagine, and at what cost?*  

For the Athenian citizen, to be free was not to invent oneself, as Rousseau or Nietzsche would later dream, but to *discover one’s place* in an order that was given, natural, divine. Consider the fate of Socrates: his trial reveals not a clash between society and the individual, but between *two visions of duty*—the city’s demand for piety and the philosopher’s obedience to his *daimonion*. Both sides appealed to a higher law; neither could conceive of a self *unmoored* from cosmic justice.  

Here lies the first great antithesis: **autonomy as self-rule versus autonomy as self-realization within the whole**.  

---

#### **II. Aristotle’s Divided Legacy: The Voluntariness Trap**  
Aristotle, that most lucid of minds, grants us the vocabulary of voluntary action (*hekousion*) but denies us the consolation of absolute agency. To act voluntarily, he insists, is to act from principles "within oneself"—yet these principles are not spun from the individual will like a spider’s thread, but *imprinted* by nature and habit.  

A sailor who throws cargo overboard in a storm acts voluntarily, but only within limits set by the winds and waves. So too the citizen: he may choose *how* to be virtuous, but not *whether* to be virtuous at all. The *Nicomachean Ethics* is a treatise on moral navigation, not moral invention.  

**Siedentop’s barb**: For Aristotle, the self is "a node in a web of roles" (*Inventing the Individual*, p. 34). The slave’s soul differs in kind from the master’s; the barbarian’s from the Greek’s. There is no universal "I."  

---

#### **III. The Sophists: A False Dawn?**  
Protagoras’ proclamation—"Man is the measure of all things"—has been hailed as the first manifesto of individualism. But this is a *half-truth*, and half-truths are often more misleading than falsehoods.  

The Sophists taught persuasion, not principle; adaptation, not authenticity. When Protagoras trains men to argue either side of a case, he does not liberate the self but *dissolves* it into technique. The democratic assembly, that roaring beast, rewards not inner conviction but the ability to *wear* convictions lightly.  

Compare this to the Stoics, those "iron men of antiquity" (as Hegel called them), who turned inward only to find a citadel *empty* of personal will. Epictetus, the slave-philosopher, preaches freedom as *amor fati*—love of fate. His is the freedom of the prisoner who no longer rattles his chains, not of the man who breaks them.  

---

#### **IV. The Unbridgeable Gulf**  
The Greek achievement was to articulate agency *without individualism*, to praise self-mastery while denying self-creation. Their tragedy was to see, with terrible clarity, the limits of human power—Oedipus, who seeks truth only to blind himself; Antigone, whose defiance is both glorious and futile.  

We moderns, children of Paul and Rousseau, can scarcely comprehend a world where to be free was to submit. Yet we inherit their unresolved tensions: **Is virtue the alignment with cosmic order, or the assertion of one’s own law?** The Greeks chose the former; Christianity, as we shall see, began—unintentionally—to make the latter possible.  





# Moral Responsibility in Early Christian Thought

As the classical world gave way to the theological universe of Christianity, the foundations of selfhood shifted. The emphasis on voluntary virtue found in Aristotle and the Stoics did not vanish, but it was absorbed, reframed, and sometimes conflicted with emerging doctrines of grace, sin, and divine omniscience. Two figures—Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas—stand out as central in transmitting and transforming the classical conception of moral agency within a Christian framework.

## Augustine: The Will and the Weight of Sin

Augustine (354–430 CE), a Roman North African bishop and former Manichean, made the concept of the will central to Christian theology. In *On Free Choice of the Will* (*De Libero Arbitrio*) \[@augustine1993], he defends the existence of free will as essential to moral responsibility, even within a universe governed by God. To blame human beings for sin, he argues, they must have the capacity to choose it.

> “If there is no voluntary sin, there is no just punishment; and if there is no just punishment, God is not just.”

However, Augustine’s theology introduces a dramatic tension. In later works such as *The City of God*, he presents the will as wounded by original sin. Humans can choose, but their ability to choose rightly is impaired. This leads him toward a doctrine of grace: we are free, but not free to be good without divine aid.

This ambivalence complicates the idea of self-reliance. On one hand, Augustine affirms voluntariness as the basis for moral agency. On the other, he shifts emphasis from the self's inner strength to its dependence on God’s grace. The path to moral authenticity now requires self-surrender, not self-assertion.

## Aquinas: Rational Will and Moral Order

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), writing nearly nine centuries later, synthesizes Aristotelian ethics with Christian doctrine. In the *Summa Theologica* \[@aquinas1947], Aquinas agrees with Aristotle that moral virtue depends on the voluntary nature of human action. But he situates this within a divine cosmic order. Free will, he argues, is part of the human capacity for reason—our ability to deliberate, to choose means toward ends, and ultimately to direct ourselves toward the good.

> “Man has free choice, otherwise counsels, exhortations, commands, prohibitions, rewards, and punishments would be in vain.” (ST I, Q83)

Aquinas’s vision is less pessimistic than Augustine’s. While acknowledging the effects of sin, he holds that human nature is fundamentally ordered toward the good, and that grace perfects rather than destroys nature. This allows him to preserve a robust concept of moral autonomy: one in which self-governance is possible and good actions are praise-worthy because they arise from rational choice.

## Theological Freedom and the Roots of Agency

Together, Augustine and Aquinas shape the Christian understanding of moral agency in ways that both affirm and constrain self-reliance. They uphold the value of voluntary action—indeed, Augustine’s critique of determinism and fatalism directly echoes Stoic and Aristotelian concerns. But they also relocate the center of moral life from individual self-mastery to divine relationship.

The human will remains vital, but it is no longer sovereign. The self is responsible, yet dependent; free, yet fallen. In this theological model, freedom is not the absence of external constraint but the alignment of the will with the divine good.

This development introduces a powerful counterpoint in the history of authenticity: the idea that to be truly oneself is not to invent one's identity, but to submit to a higher order. This Christian model of obedient agency will later come under pressure from Enlightenment thinkers, and eventually give way to more secular and expressive conceptions of the self.

In the next chapter, we will explore how the Reformation and the doctrine of predestination radicalize these tensions, challenging the very possibility of self-reliance and voluntary virtue.




# Chapter 2:

### **Chapter 2: Moral Responsibility in Early Christian Thought**  
**The Shattering of the Ancient Self**  

#### **I. The Pauline Earthquake**  
History rarely announces its revolutions in advance. When Paul of Tarsus declared that in Christ there was *“neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female”* (Galatians 3:28), he did not intend to dismantle the ancient world’s moral architecture. Yet dismantle it he did.  

Here was a claim so subversive that even its author could not fully grasp its implications: **the soul has no genealogy**. Not birth, not status, not even virtue (in the Aristotelian sense) determined one’s worth—only an inward surrender to grace. The Roman patrician and the barbarian slave stood naked before God, stripped of their social selves.  

But this radical leveling came at a price. For if the self was no longer defined by its place in the *polis* or the *familia*, what was it? A flickering candle in the wind, a vessel of divine will—yet also, paradoxically, a *responsible agent*, capable of sin and redemption.  

---

#### **II. Augustine’s Abyss: The Birth of the Inner Self**  
No thinker before Augustine had plunged so deeply into the caverns of the self—and none had emerged with such terror. *“I became a question to myself”* (*Confessions* IV.4), he cries, and in that cry, we hear the birth pangs of the modern individual.  

For Augustine, the will is not Aristotle’s rational faculty aligning with nature, nor the Stoic’s disciplined resignation. It is a **divided kingdom**, at war with itself:  
- *“The mind commands the body, and it obeys… but when it commands itself, it meets resistance.”* (*Confessions* VIII.9)  
This is no Greek tragedy of fate, but an *interior* drama—one that Luther, Kierkegaard, and Freud would inherit.  

**Siedentop’s insight**: Augustine’s tortured self-scrutiny prepares the ground for Locke’s "self-ownership" (*Inventing the Individual*, p. 112). But Augustine would have recoiled at the notion. For him, true freedom was not self-possession but *surrender*—*“Our hearts are restless until they rest in Thee.”*  

---

#### **III. The Paradox of Consent**  
Christianity’s most enduring—and unintended—gift to the West was the idea that **moral authority requires consent**.  
- In baptism, the convert *chooses* faith (even infant baptism implied communal vows).  
- In medieval canon law (Chapter 4), marriage became a *contract* of mutual consent, not a clan transaction.  

Yet this voluntarism was hedged with divine judgment. To be a self was to stand *accused*: *“Who can discern his errors? Cleanse me from hidden faults”* (Psalm 19:12). The same tradition that invented the individual also invented **guilt as a permanent condition**.  

---

#### **IV. Aquinas: The Synthesis That Failed**  
Thomas Aquinas, that great reconciler, sought to harmonize Aristotle’s rational agent with Augustine’s sinner. His verdict: Free will is *“reason’s movement toward the good”* (*Summa Theologica* I-II.13.1).  

But the synthesis was unstable. If reason naturally seeks God, why does the will rebel? Aquinas’ answer—that evil is a *privation* of good—satisfied no one. The Scholastics’ God, like Aristotle’s Unmoved Mover, was too remote to account for the anguish of a Luther or the ecstasies of a Teresa of Ávila.  

**The Fissure Widens**: By the 14th century, William of Ockham would declare God’s will *wholly arbitrary*, severing morality from reason. The self, unmoored from cosmic order, began its drift toward modernity.  

---

### **A Berlinian Coda: The Unresolved Tension**  
Christianity’s legacy is a double helix of contradictions:  
1. **Equality vs. Guilt**: It exalted the individual soul while burdening it with eternal responsibility.  
2. **Consent vs. Submission**: It made voluntariness sacred—but only within divine sovereignty.  

These tensions would explode in the Reformation (Chapter 6), fracture the Enlightenment (Chapter 8), and haunt even our secular age. For we children of Abraham and Socrates still ask: *Is the self a sovereign legislator, or a supplicant?* The answer, it seems, is both—and neither.  

**Preview of Chapter 3**: The Buddhist *anatta* (no-self) doctrine challenges this entire edifice. Can there be responsibility without a self to hold accountable?

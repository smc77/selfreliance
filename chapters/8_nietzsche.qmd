# Chapter 8: Nietzsche and the Creation of Values

With Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), the question of self-reliance takes on a radically new form—one marked not by social harmony or democratic growth, but by spiritual rupture and existential danger. Nietzsche’s work dismantles inherited systems of morality and challenges individuals to create their own values in a world where traditional sources of authority—God, reason, society—have lost their normative power. His vision of authenticity is at once liberating and perilous, centered on the individual’s capacity for self-overcoming.

## The Death of God and the Crisis of Meaning

Nietzsche’s famous declaration, “God is dead,” first articulated in *The Gay Science* (1882) and later echoed in *Thus Spoke Zarathustra* (1883–85), signifies more than religious disbelief. It is a cultural diagnosis: the collapse of metaphysical and moral certainties that had sustained Western civilization. The Enlightenment’s triumph of reason and science, Nietzsche argued, had inadvertently undermined the very values it sought to uphold.

Without a transcendent source of meaning, individuals must confront the void left by traditional morality. Nietzsche feared that most people would retreat into nihilism, embracing passivity and conformism, or clinging to residual moral frameworks already emptied of their foundations. This condition, he believed, demanded a new kind of human being.

## The Übermensch and Self-Overcoming

Nietzsche’s response to the crisis is the ideal of the *Übermensch*—the overman or higher individual who transcends herd morality and affirms life by creating his own values. This figure represents the culmination of self-reliance, not as inherited virtue or civic duty, but as existential self-assertion. In *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, Nietzsche writes:

> “Man is something that shall be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?”

Self-reliance, in this context, becomes an act of existential courage. The individual must overcome resentment (*ressentiment*), guilt, and inherited morality to affirm life in its totality, including its suffering and chaos. The *Übermensch* is not merely independent but life-affirming—capable of saying “yes” to existence and shaping meaning through artistic and moral creation.

## Will to Power and the Problem of Authenticity

At the heart of Nietzsche’s thought lies the *will to power*—a fundamental drive not simply for domination, but for creative expression, growth, and self-transcendence. This concept reframes authenticity as the realization of one’s unique potential, achieved not by conforming to fixed ideals but by continually surpassing them.

However, Nietzsche recognized that this ideal was not for the many. Most people, he warned, would succumb to what he called the “last man”—a being who seeks comfort, security, and mediocrity, avoiding challenge and greatness. Modern mass culture, with its democratic leveling and consumerist ease, fosters this condition.

The task of the individual, then, is to resist the pressures of conformity and embrace the danger of freedom. True authenticity requires the courage to become what one is—to take responsibility for one’s values, affirm one’s destiny, and act as the author of one’s life.

## Danger and Inspiration in Nietzsche’s Vision

Nietzsche’s vision of self-reliance is both inspiring and disturbing. It offers a path to radical authenticity but demands immense psychological strength. Unlike the moral universalism of Kant or the pragmatic optimism of Dewey, Nietzsche places the burden of meaning squarely on the shoulders of the individual. There is no external guarantee, no communal support, only the inner capacity to create and endure.

His critique of morality, religion, and conformity has influenced existentialism, postmodernism, and critiques of mass society. Figures like Sartre, Camus, and Foucault owe a profound debt to Nietzsche’s challenge: to invent meaning in a disenchanted world.

In the next chapter, we will turn to the existentialists themselves—who, in the shadow of Nietzsche, sought to articulate a philosophy of freedom, anguish, and responsibility in the face of absurdity and alienation.

# Chapter 12: Can Science Save Freedom?

In the modern age, the challenge to self-reliance and authenticity no longer comes only from theological determinism or political domination. Instead, it increasingly arises from the claims of science itself—particularly neuroscience and evolutionary psychology—which suggest that human behavior is determined by biological processes beyond our conscious control. Against this backdrop, contemporary philosophers like Daniel Dennett and Robert Kane have defended a conception of free will that seeks to preserve the meaningfulness of agency without denying scientific insight. This chapter explores those efforts and their implications for the ideal of self-reliance.

## The Threat of Scientific Determinism

Advances in neuroscience have raised unsettling questions about human autonomy. Studies of brain activity suggest that decisions may be initiated unconsciously before we become aware of them. Experiments like those conducted by Benjamin Libet in the 1980s appeared to show that neural readiness potentials precede conscious intention, casting doubt on the idea that we freely choose our actions.

Similarly, evolutionary psychology interprets much of human behavior as the product of adaptive instincts shaped by our ancestral environment. In this view, moral judgments, social preferences, and even political ideologies may be less rational deliberations than inherited survival strategies.

If taken to their logical conclusion, these views could undermine the very notion of moral responsibility, replacing the self-directed agent with a mechanistic or genetically programmed organism. This would erode the basis for ethics, law, and the concept of self-reliance.

## Daniel Dennett: Compatibilism and Practical Freedom

Daniel Dennett (b. 1942), in works such as *Freedom Evolves* (2003) \[@dennett2003], defends a **compatibilist** view of free will: the idea that freedom and determinism can coexist. Dennett argues that we need not be absolutely uncaused or metaphysically independent to be morally responsible. What matters is whether our actions stem from our own deliberations, values, and reasoning processes.

For Dennett, human beings are evolved, information-processing systems capable of reflecting, learning, and adjusting behavior over time. These capacities—rather than metaphysical indeterminacy—are the basis for holding people accountable. Self-reliance, in this view, means developing the cognitive and social capacities to act with foresight and intentionality, even within a causally determined world.

Dennett's account aligns with a pragmatic conception of autonomy: we are free insofar as we are responsive to reasons, sensitive to consequences, and capable of acting on long-term plans. This model supports moral education, institutional responsibility, and the cultivation of character—all themes echoed in earlier chapters.

## Robert Kane: Libertarian Free Will and Ultimate Responsibility

Robert Kane (b. 1938) offers a more ambitious defense of **libertarian free will**, arguing that genuine freedom requires **indeterminacy** at the moment of decision. In *The Significance of Free Will* (1996) \[@kane1996], Kane proposes that in moments of deep moral conflict, our will is not determined by prior causes but shaped by a process of self-forming actions (*SFAs*).

In these rare but significant cases, individuals experience internal conflict between competing values—honesty vs. loyalty, self-interest vs. duty—and must actively shape their future character. Kane argues that these decisions are not fully predictable, even in principle, and thus represent genuine exercises of freedom.

This theory grounds moral responsibility in what he calls **ultimate responsibility**: we are responsible not only for our actions, but for having become the kind of person who chooses them. This deepens the idea of self-reliance by linking it to the creation of character through conscious effort.

## Scientific Humility and Ethical Realism

Both Dennett and Kane seek to reconcile scientific insights with moral realism. They reject simplistic reductionism and insist that even in a naturalistic framework, concepts like intention, effort, and responsibility retain their normative force. Their work underscores a crucial point for the history of authenticity: freedom is not an illusion, but a complex human achievement that requires cultivation, not denial.

In different ways, these thinkers preserve space for the moral subject—an agent capable of reflective self-governance, of striving to live by reasons, and of becoming worthy of praise or blame. Their accounts affirm the value of self-reliance not as an abstract metaphysical gift, but as a hard-won developmental capacity.

As we turn to the final chapter on voluntariness and moral choice, we will examine how these insights intersect with ethical traditions that emphasize the importance of consent, intention, and freedom from manipulation as the foundation of virtue.

# Chapter 2: Moral Responsibility in Early Christian Thought

As the classical world gave way to the theological universe of Christianity, the foundations of selfhood shifted. The emphasis on voluntary virtue found in Aristotle and the Stoics did not vanish, but it was absorbed, reframed, and sometimes conflicted with emerging doctrines of grace, sin, and divine omniscience. Two figures—Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas—stand out as central in transmitting and transforming the classical conception of moral agency within a Christian framework.

## Augustine: The Will and the Weight of Sin

Augustine (354–430 CE), a Roman North African bishop and former Manichean, made the concept of the will central to Christian theology. In *On Free Choice of the Will* (*De Libero Arbitrio*) \[@augustine1993], he defends the existence of free will as essential to moral responsibility, even within a universe governed by God. To blame human beings for sin, he argues, they must have the capacity to choose it.

> “If there is no voluntary sin, there is no just punishment; and if there is no just punishment, God is not just.”

However, Augustine’s theology introduces a dramatic tension. In later works such as *The City of God*, he presents the will as wounded by original sin. Humans can choose, but their ability to choose rightly is impaired. This leads him toward a doctrine of grace: we are free, but not free to be good without divine aid.

This ambivalence complicates the idea of self-reliance. On one hand, Augustine affirms voluntariness as the basis for moral agency. On the other, he shifts emphasis from the self's inner strength to its dependence on God’s grace. The path to moral authenticity now requires self-surrender, not self-assertion.

## Aquinas: Rational Will and Moral Order

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), writing nearly nine centuries later, synthesizes Aristotelian ethics with Christian doctrine. In the *Summa Theologica* \[@aquinas1947], Aquinas agrees with Aristotle that moral virtue depends on the voluntary nature of human action. But he situates this within a divine cosmic order. Free will, he argues, is part of the human capacity for reason—our ability to deliberate, to choose means toward ends, and ultimately to direct ourselves toward the good.

> “Man has free choice, otherwise counsels, exhortations, commands, prohibitions, rewards, and punishments would be in vain.” (ST I, Q83)

Aquinas’s vision is less pessimistic than Augustine’s. While acknowledging the effects of sin, he holds that human nature is fundamentally ordered toward the good, and that grace perfects rather than destroys nature. This allows him to preserve a robust concept of moral autonomy: one in which self-governance is possible and good actions are praise-worthy because they arise from rational choice.

## Theological Freedom and the Roots of Agency

Together, Augustine and Aquinas shape the Christian understanding of moral agency in ways that both affirm and constrain self-reliance. They uphold the value of voluntary action—indeed, Augustine’s critique of determinism and fatalism directly echoes Stoic and Aristotelian concerns. But they also relocate the center of moral life from individual self-mastery to divine relationship.

The human will remains vital, but it is no longer sovereign. The self is responsible, yet dependent; free, yet fallen. In this theological model, freedom is not the absence of external constraint but the alignment of the will with the divine good.

This development introduces a powerful counterpoint in the history of authenticity: the idea that to be truly oneself is not to invent one's identity, but to submit to a higher order. This Christian model of obedient agency will later come under pressure from Enlightenment thinkers, and eventually give way to more secular and expressive conceptions of the self.

In the next chapter, we will explore how the Reformation and the doctrine of predestination radicalize these tensions, challenging the very possibility of self-reliance and voluntary virtue.




# Chapter 2: Moral Responsibility in Early Christian Thought

The arrival of Christianity in the Mediterranean world posed a fundamental challenge to Greek assumptions about virtue and voluntary choice. If the Greeks had located moral worth in rational self-determination and the cultivation of excellence through disciplined choice, Christianity introduced a radically different framework: human beings as fallen creatures, dependent on divine grace for salvation, yet somehow still responsible for their moral choices. This tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility would generate some of the most sophisticated thinking about free will and moral agency in the history of Western philosophy.

The early Christian understanding of choice and responsibility emerged from a theological revolution. Unlike the Greek gods, who inhabited the same cosmos as humans and were subject to fate, the Christian God was conceived as utterly transcendent—the creator of all that exists, beyond time and space, omniscient and omnipotent. This God did not simply reward virtue and punish vice according to cosmic law; He offered salvation as a free gift to undeserving sinners. Yet Christianity also insisted that humans bore real responsibility for their acceptance or rejection of this gift, and for the moral choices they made in response to divine revelation.

## Augustine's Paradox: Freedom, Sin, and Grace

No thinker grappled more profoundly with these tensions than Augustine of Hippo (354-430). His intellectual journey from Manichean dualism through Neoplatonic philosophy to Christian orthodoxy forced him to confront fundamental questions about human agency that the Greeks had not fully anticipated. If God is perfectly good and omnipotent, why does evil exist? If humans are created good, why do they choose evil? If they are corrupted by sin, how can they be held responsible for choices they cannot avoid making?

Augustine's answer evolved through decades of theological controversy, but its core insight remained constant: human freedom is not the Greek ideal of rational self-determination, but rather the capacity to choose the good that comes from proper relationship with God. In his early work *On Free Will* (De Libero Arbitrio), written as a dialogue around 395, Augustine argues that God created humans with free will precisely so that their choices could have genuine moral significance. A person who does good only because he cannot do otherwise would not be praiseworthy; genuine virtue requires the real possibility of vice.

But Augustine's mature understanding, developed through his conflicts with the Pelagians in the early fifth century, complicated this picture dramatically. In works like *The City of God* and his anti-Pelagian treatises, he argues that the Fall has corrupted human nature so thoroughly that people cannot, through their own efforts, choose genuine good. They retain the formal capacity for choice—they are not physically compelled to sin—but their wills are so disordered by pride and self-love that they inevitably choose themselves over God, creatures over Creator, temporal goods over eternal ones.

This is Augustine's famous doctrine of the "bondage of the will." Humans after the Fall possess what he calls *liberum arbitrium* (free choice) but not *libertas* (true freedom). They can choose between various finite goods and evils, but they cannot choose the highest good—God himself—without divine grace. Like an addict who "freely" chooses his drug but cannot choose sobriety, fallen humans freely choose sin but cannot choose righteousness.

Yet Augustine insists that this bondage does not eliminate moral responsibility. People are responsible for their sins precisely because they flow from their own wills, even if those wills are corrupted. A person who commits adultery is not compelled by external force; the action emerges from his own desires and choices. That those desires are disordered and those choices emerge from a corrupted nature does not excuse the person but rather explains what needs to be healed.

## The Paradox of Divine Grace and Human Responsibility

Augustine's doctrine of grace creates what may be the deepest paradox in Christian thinking about moral responsibility. If humans cannot choose salvation without divine grace, and if God gives that grace only to some (the "elect"), then in what sense are the damned responsible for their rejection of salvation? Augustine's answer is characteristically subtle and has been debated for sixteen centuries.

Divine grace, Augustine argues, does not violate human freedom but rather restores it. Grace heals the will so that it can once again choose the good freely and joyfully. The person who receives grace does not feel compelled to believe or to love God; rather, grace changes what he wants most deeply. Where once he found his ultimate satisfaction in finite goods that inevitably disappointed, now he finds it in God who alone can fulfill human longing completely.

This means that both salvation and damnation involve genuine choice, but choice of different kinds. The elect choose salvation because grace has given them new desires and new capacities for choice. The reprobate choose damnation because they persist in the disordered loves that characterize fallen humanity. Both choices are "free" in the sense that they flow from the agent's own will, but only the first is free in the deeper sense of being oriented toward humanity's true good.

Augustine illustrates this with his famous analysis of infant baptism and original sin. Infants who die unbaptized are condemned not for their personal choices (they have made none) but for their participation in the corrupted human nature inherited from Adam. Their damnation is just because the corruption is real, even though it is not something they personally chose. Their salvation, when it occurs through baptism, is pure gift—they have done nothing to merit it and could do nothing to merit it.

This doctrine scandalized Augustine's contemporary Pelagius, who insisted that God's justice requires that humans be capable of achieving righteousness through their own efforts. If people are commanded to be holy, Pelagius argued, they must be capable of holiness; otherwise God would be unjust to punish their failures. Augustine's response was that Pelagius misunderstood both the depth of human corruption and the graciousness of divine mercy. God does not owe salvation to anyone; that He offers it at all is pure grace.

## Aquinas and the Synthesis of Reason and Grace

Eight centuries later, Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) attempted to synthesize Augustinian theology with Aristotelian philosophy in ways that would profoundly influence subsequent thinking about free will and moral responsibility. Aquinas was deeply committed to both Augustine's insights about sin and grace and Aristotle's analysis of voluntary action and rational choice. His achievement was to show how these two traditions could be integrated without sacrificing the core insights of either.

Aquinas begins with Aristotle's understanding of choice as rational appetite—the will following upon the intellect's judgment about what is good. Human beings naturally desire happiness (*beatitudo*), and all their particular choices can be understood as attempts to achieve this ultimate end. The person who chooses wealth, pleasure, honor, or knowledge does so because he judges (correctly or incorrectly) that it will contribute to his overall well-being.

But Aquinas argues that the ultimate object of human desire is not any finite good but God himself—the perfect good that alone can satisfy the human longing for happiness completely. This creates what he calls the "specification of the will"—humans are naturally oriented toward the infinite good, even when they choose finite goods. The will is free with respect to particular goods (we can choose this or that finite option) but naturally necessitated with respect to the ultimate good (we cannot choose to be unhappy, though we can choose things that make us unhappy).

This Thomistic framework allows Aquinas to preserve both human freedom and divine sovereignty. Humans are free because they can deliberate about means to their ultimate end and choose among various options. They are responsible for their choices because these choices flow from their own rational judgments about what will contribute to their happiness. Yet they are also dependent on God, both as the creator of their rational nature and as the ultimate object toward which that nature is oriented.

Aquinas's account of sin follows naturally from this analysis. Sin occurs when humans choose finite goods as if they were ultimate—when they treat wealth, pleasure, power, or even human relationships as capable of providing the complete satisfaction that only God can provide. This is not simply an intellectual mistake but a moral disorder that affects both intellect and will. Sin darkens the mind's ability to judge correctly about genuine goods and corrupts the will's capacity to choose them consistently.

Yet Aquinas maintains that even in sin, humans retain their fundamental capacity for free choice. Unlike Augustine's more pessimistic assessment, Aquinas argues that fallen humans can still choose genuine natural goods—they can be just, courageous, temperate, and prudent in their dealings with finite realities. What they cannot do without grace is order their entire lives toward their ultimate supernatural end, which is the vision of God in the next life.

## Free Will as Rational Choice Toward the Good

The Thomistic synthesis represents perhaps the most sophisticated attempt in medieval thought to reconcile human freedom with divine sovereignty. Aquinas's key insight is that freedom is not arbitrary choice but rational choice toward the good. The will is most free when it chooses what is genuinely best for the person as a rational creature oriented toward ultimate happiness.

This understanding of freedom differs markedly from modern conceptions that emphasize the absence of constraint and the ability to choose otherwise. For Aquinas, a person would be more free, not less, if he were unable to choose evil—just as a person would be more free if he were unable to choose what would make him miserable. Perfect freedom would involve the perfect alignment of choice with genuine good, which is why the blessed in heaven (who cannot sin) are perfectly free rather than constrained.

This Thomistic conception of freedom as "liberty for excellence" rather than "liberty of indifference" has profound implications for thinking about moral responsibility. People are responsible not simply because they could have chosen differently, but because their choices express their fundamental orientation toward or away from their authentic good. The person who chooses vice is responsible because he has chosen what is genuinely contrary to his nature as a rational being made for happiness in God.

Aquinas's framework also provides resources for thinking about degrees of responsibility that are more nuanced than either purely voluntarist or purely determinist approaches. People can be more or less responsible depending on the extent to which their choices flow from clear rational judgment about genuine goods. The person who acts from passion, ignorance, fear, or external pressure is less fully responsible than the person who acts from calm deliberation with full knowledge of circumstances.

## The Unresolved Tension

Despite the sophistication of Augustinian and Thomistic accounts of free will and moral responsibility, early Christian thought never fully resolved the fundamental tension between divine sovereignty and human freedom. Augustine's emphasis on the bondage of the will and the necessity of grace seemed to many to undermine genuine moral responsibility, while Aquinas's more optimistic assessment of human rational capacity seemed to some to underestimate the effects of sin.

This tension would become even more acute in the Protestant Reformation, when thinkers like Luther and Calvin would push Augustinian insights about human corruption and divine sovereignty to their logical extreme. If humans are "dead in sin" and salvation depends entirely on divine election, what becomes of moral responsibility and the meaningfulness of human choice?

But the tension also reflects something deeper about the Christian understanding of human nature itself. Christianity simultaneously affirms human dignity (created in the image of God, destined for eternal happiness) and human corruption (fallen, sinful, dependent on grace). It insists both that humans are responsible moral agents and that they are utterly dependent on divine mercy. These affirmations may not be logically contradictory, but they create a permanent tension in Christian thinking about moral responsibility.

## The Christian Transformation of Voluntary Choice

What Christianity added to Greek thinking about voluntary choice was not primarily a different analysis of the conditions that make actions voluntary—Augustine and Aquinas largely accepted Aristotelian insights about knowledge, deliberation, and the absence of compulsion. Rather, Christianity transformed the context within which voluntary choice operates and the ultimate criteria by which it is evaluated.

For the Greeks, the highest form of voluntary choice was the rational pursuit of virtue and eudaimonia through disciplined self-cultivation. For Christians, the highest form of voluntary choice became the grateful acceptance of divine grace and the orientation of one's entire life toward God as the ultimate good. This shift had several important consequences.

First, it relocated the source of moral transformation from human effort to divine gift. While the Greeks emphasized the gradual cultivation of virtue through repeated good choices, Christians emphasized the sudden transformation of the heart through divine grace. This did not eliminate the importance of ongoing moral effort, but it subordinated such effort to the prior work of God in the soul.

Second, it introduced a more radical understanding of human equality before God. While the Greeks acknowledged that people had different natural capacities for virtue, they generally assumed that these differences were morally significant. Christians, by contrast, insisted that all humans are equally fallen and equally dependent on grace. The moral distinctions that matter ultimately are not those based on natural talent or social position, but those based on the acceptance or rejection of divine mercy.

Third, it complicated the relationship between virtue and happiness. While the Greeks generally assumed that virtue and eudaimonia were closely connected (though they disagreed about the exact nature of this connection), Christians distinguished between earthly happiness and eternal blessedness. The saint might suffer greatly in this life while remaining perfectly virtuous, just as the sinner might prosper while remaining fundamentally disordered in his relationship to God.

## Implications for Later Thought

The Christian contribution to thinking about voluntary choice and moral responsibility would prove enormously influential for later intellectual history. The Augustinian emphasis on the corruption of human willing and the necessity of grace would inspire Protestant reformers and contribute to more pessimistic assessments of human moral capacity. The Thomistic synthesis of reason and faith would influence Catholic natural law thinking and contribute to more optimistic assessments of human rational capability.

But perhaps most importantly, Christianity introduced the idea that the ultimate context for evaluating human choice is not simply the natural order but the relationship between the human person and a transcendent God who offers salvation as a free gift. This created new possibilities for thinking about human dignity (based on divine love rather than natural excellence) and new challenges for thinking about moral responsibility (how to preserve human agency within the context of divine sovereignty).

These Christian insights about grace, sin, and divine sovereignty would prove particularly challenging to later Enlightenment attempts to ground human dignity and moral responsibility in rational autonomy alone. If Augustine and Aquinas were right that humans are fundamentally dependent creatures whose choices are meaningful only within the context of their relationship to God, then the Enlightenment project of autonomous moral self-legislation might be based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human nature.

At the same time, the Christian emphasis on the importance of each individual's eternal destiny would contribute to growing recognition of the dignity and worth of every human person. If God cares enough about each individual to offer him salvation, and if each person's eternal fate depends on his response to that offer, then individual choice and responsibility take on cosmic significance that exceeds anything the Greeks had imagined.

The tension between these two insights—human dependence and human dignity, divine sovereignty and individual responsibility—would continue to generate creative theological and philosophical reflection for centuries. It would also create space for the later development of more secular approaches to human freedom and moral responsibility, as thinkers attempted to preserve Christian insights about human dignity while dispensing with Christian doctrines about divine grace and eternal destiny.

### **Chapter 2: Moral Responsibility in Early Christian Thought**  
**The Shattering of the Ancient Self**  

#### **I. The Pauline Earthquake**  
History rarely announces its revolutions in advance. When Paul of Tarsus declared that in Christ there was *“neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female”* (Galatians 3:28), he did not intend to dismantle the ancient world’s moral architecture. Yet dismantle it he did.  

Here was a claim so subversive that even its author could not fully grasp its implications: **the soul has no genealogy**. Not birth, not status, not even virtue (in the Aristotelian sense) determined one’s worth—only an inward surrender to grace. The Roman patrician and the barbarian slave stood naked before God, stripped of their social selves.  

But this radical leveling came at a price. For if the self was no longer defined by its place in the *polis* or the *familia*, what was it? A flickering candle in the wind, a vessel of divine will—yet also, paradoxically, a *responsible agent*, capable of sin and redemption.  

---

#### **II. Augustine’s Abyss: The Birth of the Inner Self**  
No thinker before Augustine had plunged so deeply into the caverns of the self—and none had emerged with such terror. *“I became a question to myself”* (*Confessions* IV.4), he cries, and in that cry, we hear the birth pangs of the modern individual.  

For Augustine, the will is not Aristotle’s rational faculty aligning with nature, nor the Stoic’s disciplined resignation. It is a **divided kingdom**, at war with itself:  
- *“The mind commands the body, and it obeys… but when it commands itself, it meets resistance.”* (*Confessions* VIII.9)  
This is no Greek tragedy of fate, but an *interior* drama—one that Luther, Kierkegaard, and Freud would inherit.  

**Siedentop’s insight**: Augustine’s tortured self-scrutiny prepares the ground for Locke’s "self-ownership" (*Inventing the Individual*, p. 112). But Augustine would have recoiled at the notion. For him, true freedom was not self-possession but *surrender*—*“Our hearts are restless until they rest in Thee.”*  

---

#### **III. The Paradox of Consent**  
Christianity’s most enduring—and unintended—gift to the West was the idea that **moral authority requires consent**.  
- In baptism, the convert *chooses* faith (even infant baptism implied communal vows).  
- In medieval canon law (Chapter 4), marriage became a *contract* of mutual consent, not a clan transaction.  

Yet this voluntarism was hedged with divine judgment. To be a self was to stand *accused*: *“Who can discern his errors? Cleanse me from hidden faults”* (Psalm 19:12). The same tradition that invented the individual also invented **guilt as a permanent condition**.  

---

#### **IV. Aquinas: The Synthesis That Failed**  
Thomas Aquinas, that great reconciler, sought to harmonize Aristotle’s rational agent with Augustine’s sinner. His verdict: Free will is *“reason’s movement toward the good”* (*Summa Theologica* I-II.13.1).  

But the synthesis was unstable. If reason naturally seeks God, why does the will rebel? Aquinas’ answer—that evil is a *privation* of good—satisfied no one. The Scholastics’ God, like Aristotle’s Unmoved Mover, was too remote to account for the anguish of a Luther or the ecstasies of a Teresa of Ávila.  

**The Fissure Widens**: By the 14th century, William of Ockham would declare God’s will *wholly arbitrary*, severing morality from reason. The self, unmoored from cosmic order, began its drift toward modernity.  

---

### **A Berlinian Coda: The Unresolved Tension**  
Christianity’s legacy is a double helix of contradictions:  
1. **Equality vs. Guilt**: It exalted the individual soul while burdening it with eternal responsibility.  
2. **Consent vs. Submission**: It made voluntariness sacred—but only within divine sovereignty.  

These tensions would explode in the Reformation (Chapter 6), fracture the Enlightenment (Chapter 8), and haunt even our secular age. For we children of Abraham and Socrates still ask: *Is the self a sovereign legislator, or a supplicant?* The answer, it seems, is both—and neither.  

**Preview of Chapter 3**: The Buddhist *anatta* (no-self) doctrine challenges this entire edifice. Can there be responsibility without a self to hold accountable?

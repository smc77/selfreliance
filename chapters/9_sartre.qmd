 # Existentialism and Freedom Under Pressure

The existentialists took up Nietzsche’s challenge and developed a philosophy grounded in individual freedom, subjective meaning, and personal responsibility in a disenchanted world. Building on the collapse of traditional religious and moral structures, thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus examined what it means to live authentically in the face of absurdity, alienation, and anxiety. In doing so, they articulated a distinctive modern account of self-reliance—one shaped not by optimism or idealism, but by confrontation with contingency and despair.

## Sartre: Radical Freedom and Bad Faith

Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980), in *Being and Nothingness* (1943) \[@sartre2007], argued that human beings are radically free. Unlike objects, which have fixed essences, human consciousness is defined by its ability to transcend itself, to project toward future possibilities. Sartre famously declared:

> "Existence precedes essence."

This means that we are not born with a predefined nature or purpose; rather, we must create our own identities through action. Authenticity, for Sartre, consists in acknowledging this freedom and accepting the responsibility it entails. To deny our freedom—to hide behind social roles, conventions, or deterministic excuses—is to live in *bad faith* (*mauvaise foi*).

Sartre’s existentialist ethics places the full burden of meaning-making on the individual. In a godless universe, there is no external justification for our choices. As he writes in *Existentialism is a Humanism* (1946):

> “Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.” \[@sartre2007]

Self-reliance, in this vision, is the courage to live without guarantees and to assume full responsibility for one’s existence.

## Camus: The Absurd Rebel

Albert Camus (1913–1960), though often associated with existentialism, preferred the term "absurdist." In *The Myth of Sisyphus* (1942) \[@camus1991], Camus describes the human condition as fundamentally absurd: we seek meaning in a universe that offers none. This confrontation between rational longing and silent nature defines the absurd.

Camus rejects both religious consolation and nihilistic despair. Instead, he calls for a form of heroic defiance. His image of Sisyphus—condemned to roll a boulder up a hill for eternity—illustrates this stance:

> “The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”

In *The Rebel* (1951) \[@camus1991], Camus extends this vision into a political and moral critique. The authentic individual affirms life through rebellion—not in the sense of violent insurrection, but through fidelity to a shared human dignity, even in the absence of metaphysical foundations. Camus’s rebel is self-reliant not because he controls the world, but because he chooses to resist injustice and absurdity with lucidity and moral integrity.

## Beauvoir: Authenticity, Gender, and Freedom

Simone de Beauvoir (1908–1986), in *The Ethics of Ambiguity* (1947) and *The Second Sex* (1949) \[@beauvoir2010], extends existentialist themes to address questions of gender, oppression, and relational autonomy. Like Sartre, she asserts that humans are condemned to be free, but she emphasizes the situatedness of that freedom—especially how social structures constrain and distort the development of authentic selfhood.

For Beauvoir, women have often been denied subjectivity, cast as the "Other" in relation to man. Overcoming this requires not only external liberation but internal affirmation of agency:

> "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman." \[@beauvoir2010]

Authenticity involves not only choosing for oneself but recognizing and supporting the freedom of others. Beauvoir thus transforms self-reliance into an ethical relationship, where autonomy and solidarity are interwoven.

## Freedom, Responsibility, and Anxiety

The existentialists share a commitment to voluntariness and moral responsibility, but they underscore the weight—and often the anguish—of that freedom. In a world without divine order or moral certainty, each person must navigate the tension between possibility and constraint, solitude and solidarity.

Their contribution to the intellectual history of self-reliance lies in their insistence that authenticity is not comfort but courage. It requires a confrontation with mortality, contingency, and ambiguity. Where earlier thinkers celebrated autonomy in more confident or optimistic terms, the existentialists dramatize its cost and depth.

As we turn next to thinkers who offered religious counterpoints and communitarian critiques, we will see how existentialism’s radical individualism provoked strong reactions—and how alternative visions of selfhood reasserted the value of tradition, community, and transcendent meaning.

# Preface {.unnumbered}

> Virtue or excellence is, as we have seen, concerned with emotions and actions.  When these are voluntary we receive praise and blame; when involuntary, we are pardoned and sometimes pitied.  Therefore, it is, I dare say, indispensable for a student of virtue to differentiate between voluntary and involuntary actions, and useful also for lawgivers, to help them in meting out honors and punishments. - Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book 3

> Be yourself; no base imitator of another, but your best self...Listen to the inward voice and bravely obey that. - Emerson, "Self-Reliance"

> The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs... J.S. Mill, On Liberty

[Quote from "Free to Choose"]

It has become fashionable to find esoteric explanations for human progress, to shun the standard canon.  But it is often the case that occam's razor applies, and the simplest explanation is also the best.



## Responsibility is not Anarchistic

Saying that self-reliance is an important virtue is not to say that every possible path is equally good.  This is one of the inherent tensions in public life.  Being able to thrive individually means making good choices that fit within your character and within society.


## Character

What does it mean to be authentic?  

Thriving as an individual requires a sense of realism.  The advice to the young to "follow your passion" or "shoot for the stars" 


## Self-Knowledge and Education

Underlying self-reliance is a clear-eyed understanding of the self, along with a belief in the possibility of self-improvement.  


## Emerson

Perhaps no one is more closely associated with *self-reliance* than Ralph Waldo Emerson.


## Free to Choose

Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics (@aristotle1985) reflects extensively on the tight connection between virtue and voluntary action.  

At the heart of the libertarian philosophy is *choice*, yet underpinning our affection for choosing is an unseen framework of beliefs.  Within J.S. Mill's 

Having regret is a feeling that *we could have done otherwise*.

[Story about man with brain damage who committed murder.]

In statistics, we talk about a *counter factual*.  

## Coercion, with good intentions 

The tyranny of experts and iatrogenic harm.  Example of shoe company that donates shoes, killing local businesses.

Foreign aid vs. non-profit sector.

In modern America, there is a "pro choice" movement which emphasizes that women should have control over their own bodies, and have the right to an abortion.  Is this a clear example of the virtue of agency?  Not necessarily, as the counter argument runs that this violates the choice of the unborn child to live, and so the determination of where the agency lies depends on a definition of when life begins, and that is a question of custom.

What about an old person's decision to have an assisted suicide?  

## Individuals and Groups

It hasn't always been the case that individuals possessed a sense of agency.  (@siedentop2014)

Even today, there's a huge gap between the West and the rest of the world. (@henrich2020)


## Agency and Responsibility

What does it mean to have responsibility for your actions?  

Does a person bear *more* responsibility if they are more intelligent?

## Community and Bowling Alone


Taking personal responsibility *comes first*.  

This is not to say that community and connection are unimportant.  Sometimes we need help.  One of the most important lessons in Economics is the division of labor.  That division of labor runs all the way down, such that it's entirely impossible for an individual to research every topic in depth and we must rely on expertise in every dimension of our lives.


## The Challenge

Self-reliance is a Western, but a uniquely Amerian idea as we will aim to show.

> Virtue or excellence is, as we have seen, concerned with emotions and actions.  When these are voluntary we receive praise and blame; when involuntary, we are pardoned and sometimes pitied.  Therefore, it is, I dare say, indispensable for a student of virtue to differentiate between voluntary and involuntary actions, and useful also for lawgivers, to help them in meting out honors and punishments. - Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book 3

[Quote from "Free to Choose"]

## Free to Choose

Book III of the Nicomachean Ethics (@aristotle1985) reflects extensively on the tight connection between virtue and voluntary action.  

At the heart of the libertarian philosophy is *choice*, yet underpinning our affection for choosing is an unseen framework of beliefs.  Within J.S. Mill's 

Having regret is a feeling that *we could have done otherwise*.

[Story about man with brain damage who committed murder.]

In statistics, we talk about a *counter factual*.  

## Coercion, with good intentions 

The tyranny of experts and iatrogenic harm.  Example of shoe company that donates shoes, killing local businesses.

Foreign aid vs. non-profit sector.

In modern America, there is a "pro choice" movement which emphasizes that women should have control over their own bodies, and have the right to an abortion.  Is this a clear example of the virtue of agency?  Not necessarily, as the counter argument runs that this violates the choice of the unborn child to live, and so the determination of where the agency lies depends on a definition of when life begins, and that is a question of custom.

What about an old person's decision to have an assisted suicide?  

## Individuals and Groups

It hasn't always been the case that individuals possessed a sense of agency.

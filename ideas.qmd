Core ideas:

1. Voluntary choice is morally superior to coerced action.
2. The locust of coercion: religion, political, cultural (?), and scientific


## Classical Sources

**Immanuel Kant** - The foundational defender of this view:
- *Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals* (1785) - His argument that moral worth requires acting from duty rather than inclination, and that autonomy is the basis of human dignity
- *Critique of Practical Reason* (1788) - Further development of moral autonomy
- *"What is Enlightenment?"* (1784) - The famous essay on intellectual freedom and self-determination

**John Stuart Mill**:
- *On Liberty* (1859) - Especially Chapter 3, "Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being," where he argues that "He who does anything because it is the custom, makes no choice" and that moral faculties are only developed through free choice
- *Utilitarianism* (1863) - His defense of higher pleasures and the development of individual character

## Contemporary Philosophical Works

**Alan Wertheimer** - *Coercion* (1987) - A comprehensive philosophical analysis of when choices are genuinely voluntary vs. coercive, and why this distinction matters morally.

**Gerald Dworkin** - *The Theory and Practice of Autonomy* (1988) - Explores different conceptions of autonomy and their moral significance.

**Joel Feinberg** - *Harm to Self* (1986) - Part of his four-volume work on moral and legal philosophy, focusing on paternalism and when intervention in voluntary choices is justified.

**Harry Frankfurt** - Multiple influential essays:
- "Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person" (1971)
- "The Importance of What We Care About" (1988)
- These explore what makes choices genuinely "ours" and when we're responsible for them

## Historical Sources You Might Consider

**Aristotle** - *Nicomachean Ethics*, Books III and X - On voluntary action and the conditions needed for moral responsibility.

**John Locke** - *A Letter Concerning Toleration* (1689) and *Two Treatises of Government* (1689) - Early liberal arguments for the moral importance of consent and voluntary association.

**Benjamin Constant** - *"The Liberty of the Ancients Compared with that of the Moderns"* (1819) - Influential essay distinguishing political participation from individual freedom.

## Critiques Worth Engaging

**Isaiah Berlin** - *"Two Concepts of Liberty"* (1958) - Challenges simple equations of freedom with moral value.

**Gerald Dworkin** - *"Paternalism"* (1972) - When might coercion actually serve autonomy?

**Alasdair MacIntyre** - *After Virtue* (1981) - Communitarian critique of liberal emphasis on individual choice.

The Kant and Mill texts are absolutely essential for your project, as they provide the clearest philosophical articulations of why voluntary choice has special moral status. Wertheimer's *Coercion* would be particularly valuable for understanding contemporary debates about the boundaries between voluntary and coerced action.
